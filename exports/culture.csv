This is mentioned in the books Pararaton and Negara Kartagama (D.J Brandes, 1897). Etymologically, the name Wĕngkĕr derives from the phrase wĕngonan angker 'haunted place', which refers to the concept of a place filled with mystical and supernatural aura (Moelyadi, 1986). In the Serat Centhini, canto 213, as translated by Stein Callenfels, there is a narrative that strengthens the historical legacy of Panaraga, which asserts that Wĕngkĕr held an important position in the history of classical Javanese civilization and became the undeniable historical identity of Panaraga.\n\n Geographically, the Panaraga sub-ethnic group refers to the area in the western part of East Java Province, now known as Ponorogo Regency, stretching from the western side of Mount Wilis to eastern side of Mount Lawu. According to Junghuhn's records (1855), numerous altars and terraces resembling worship sites were discovered, which were considered by ancient Javanese society as the dwelling places of gods and sacred crowns. Valentijn (1862) provided a more detailed description that the Panaraga region stretched from Pacitan Bay on the southern coast to Sumbang Village with approximately 150 families, extending two miles east of Mount Lawu, bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south and Lodaya to the east, with the Semangi River in Sangkulang Village serving as an important geographical marker and Mount Wilis as a natural boundary between Panaraga, Nganjuk and Kediri.\n\n In sociocultural context, the Dutch Resident in Madiun, Lucien Adam (1938), provided interesting anthropological notes regarding the characteristics of the Panaraga sub-ethnic community: \n\n The mystery of the origin of the Panaraga people has not been clearly revealed. Although they do not live in isolation from the surrounding areas, their types and characters differ from surrounding districts. People from Panaraga are more independent and self-confident, but also tough, brave, reckless, quick-tempered, and prefer to travel compared to average people in central Java.\n\n Adam's observations reveal the unique temperament of the Panaraga ethnic group, which differs from the general Javanese ethnic group, possessing an independent, brave, and highly adventurous spirit, represented by the figure of Warok as their sociocultural identity. Terminologically, Warok comes from the word waro'i or wirangi, which means 'already understands both physically and spiritually, whose actions are solely to help others', or from the word wewarah (Arabic: wara') which means 'to distance oneself from doubtful things', thus Warok can be interpreted as individual with supernatural power who uses their abilities for social good and holds a high status in Panaraga society. \n\n The existence of Warok cannot be separated from the art of reyog—both are like two sides of a coin united in the ethnic identity of Panaraga. The word reyog itself has various debated interpretations, ranging from the onomatopoeic hypothesis of the riyeg-riyeg bamboo sound to Mbah Wo Kucing's philosophical interpretation, which states REYOG as an acronym for five spiritual elements (R: rasa kidung (feeling of song), E: engwang sukma adiluhung (noble soul's essence), Y: Yang Widhi (The Divine), O: olah kridhaning Gusti (the Lord's creative act), G: gelar gumulung kĕrsaning Kang Maha Kuasa (the unfolding of the Almighty's will)), which means that reyog is not merely a performing art but a spiritual medium that connects humans with the divine dimension through artistic expression rich in the philosophical values of the Ponorogo community.\n\nRegardless of various etymological interpretations, the art of reyog was born from a complex socio-political context as a form of criticism by Warok Ki Ageng Kutu Suryaalam against the Majapahit government under the rule of King Brawijaya V, which was considered overly dominated by the queen consort. The phenomenon is symbolized in the form of singa barong or dadak merak—a tiger's head with a peacock's neck—which represents a subtle satire of a leadership that has lost its direction and power. \n\nPanaraga, with its historical and cultural identity, offers a unique depiction of cultural complexity within the mosaic of Javanese culture, featuring Warok as a central figure and reyog as an artistic expression rich in cultural and philosophical meaning. Therefore, this cultural heritage not only becomes a historical asset but also a living identity that must be continuously preserved by future generations as the proud ethnic identity of Panaraga."",""cultureId"":6,""status"":""PUBLISHED"",""statusKonservasi"":""TREATED"",""createdAt"":""2025-11-06T05:42:44.158Z"",""updatedAt"":""2025-11-14T05:57:13.451Z"",""artiSalamKhas"":""We are Children of Panaraga People."",""statusPriorityDisplay"":""HIGH""},{""subcultureId"":7,""namaSubculture"":""Madura"",""slug"":""madura"",""salamKhas"":""Abeje "",""penjelasan"":""The Madura subculture from Madura Island, Madurese ethnicity with distinctive features like karapan sapi (bull racing), Madurese language, and high self-esteem values; the community is religious (Islamic), focused on fishing, salt farming, and migration traditions."",""cultureId"":6,""status"":""PUBLISHED"",""statusKonservasi"":""MAINTAINED"",""createdAt"":""2025-11-06T05:42:49.407Z"",""updatedAt"":""2025-11-06T05:42:49.934Z"",""artiSalamKhas"":""(hello, in Madurese language)"",""statusPriorityDisplay"":""LOW""},{""subcultureId"":3,""namaSubculture"":""Pandhalungan"",""slug"":""pandhalungan"",""salamKhas"":""Sugeng enjing "",""penjelasan"":""The Pandalungan subculture from the Tapal Kuda region (such as Jember, Lumajang), a result of Javanese and Madurese ethnic mixing; distinctive hybrid features like rujak cingur food, mixed language, and egalitarian values in farming communities."",""cultureId"":6,""status"":""PUBLISHED"",""statusKonservasi"":""TREATED"",""createdAt"":""2025-11-06T05:42:45.207Z"",""updatedAt"":""2025-11-06T05:42:45.732Z"",""artiSalamKhas"":""(good morning, a mix of Javanese-Madurese)"",""statusPriorityDisplay"":""LOW""},{""subcultureId"":9,""namaSubculture"":""Madura-Kangean"",""slug"":""madura-kangean"",""salamKhas"":""Abeje "",""penjelasan"":""The Madura-Kangean subculture from the Kangean Islands, eastern Madurese ethnicity with Bugis-Makassar mix; distinctive features include buffalo fighting, Kangean language, and resilience values; focused on fishing and agriculture in remote islands.1"",""cultureId"":6,""status"":""PUBLISHED"",""statusKonservasi"":""TREATED"",""createdAt"":""2025-11-06T05:42:51.508Z"",""updatedAt"":""2025-11-06T05:42:52.033Z"",""artiSalamKhas"":""(hello, Madurese variation)"",""statusPriorityDisplay"":""LOW""},{""subcultureId"":4,""namaSubculture"":""Osing"",""slug"":""osing"",""salamKhas"":""Sugeng rawuh "",""penjelasan"":""The Osing subculture from Banyuwangi, descendants of the Blambangan Kingdom; distinctive features include Osing language (similar to ancient Javanese), gandrung dance, ider bumi tradition, and Hindu-Buddhist beliefs mixed with Islam; focused on preserving Majapahit heritage."",""cultureId"":6,""status"":""PUBLISHED"",""statusKonservasi"":""MAINTAINED"",""createdAt"":""2025-11-06T05:42:46.257Z"",""updatedAt"":""2025-11-06T05:42:46.781Z"",""artiSalamKhas"":""(welcome, in Osing language)"",""statusPriorityDisplay"":""LOW""},{""subcultureId"":25,""namaSubculture"":""Tengger"",""slug"":""tengger"",""salamKhas"":""Hong Ulun Basuki Langgeng"",""penjelasan"":""Introduction\n\n Tengger in Old Javanese means “highlands” (Gericke and Roorda, 1901:918), and thus the meaning of Wong Tengger would have mean persons who lived in highlands. In nowadays Java, Tengger no longer refer to that, but cover to “perch and sit above” (Hefner, 1985:25). Wong Tengger ‘Tengger People’ are indigenous community who resides and surrounds around the slope of Mountain Brahma (Bromo). The Tengger highlands locates to the northeast from Malang. There are three gates to reach there: (1) the first route is going to the north from Malang to Pasuruan or Purwodadi, we will find the main entrance Wonokitri village in Tosari district and going up to the Ngadiwono village. These regions well known as western side (brang kulon) of Tengger highlands; (2) the second route is heading to Probolinggo, we will reach the main entrance is Cemoro Lawang village (Ngadisari district) and directly overlooks mount Bromo and Tengger caldera. These gates are popularly known as eastern side (brang wetan) of Tengger highlands; (3) the third access has two kinds of gates: (1) heading to Tumpang, Malang then we will reach the Gubugklakah, and the main gate is Ngadas village; (2) heading to Lumajang, and climbing to Senduro, Ranupani. These regions are known as southern (brang kidul) of Tengger highlands.\n\nHong hulun Basuki Langgeng\n\nHong Hulun Basuki Langgeng is Tenggerese salutation. This formula consists of four words in Old Javenese: Oṅ or Om is often referred to mantra or formula praise; ṅhulun is the usual pronoun for the first person (Zoetmulder:1982). Whilst the rest of the words are still existed in modern Javanese, basuki means well-being, and laṅgĕṅ holds the meaning permanent. So, the Tenggerese salutation can be interpreted in the following: “Om, (Brahmā, Visnū, Sivā), I wish for eternal well-being”. Then, the receiver will reply: basuki laṅgĕṅ ‘well-being forever’. This salutation is given when someone visit their relatives by knocking the door or for maintaining social relationship among Tenggerese when they meet each other in market or climbing up to the Bromo.\n\nDukun Panḍita as divine actors \n\nIn order to maintain the divine relationship between the people of Tengger and their deities and ancestor, the role of dukun panḍita (priest of Tengger) is central (Sukmawan, 2022:14). In the rituals that they perform, the priest is acting like the middleman who mediate the realm world to divine world. By uttering their formulas (mantra) and mentioning the means of the ritual, the priest communicates to the unseen figures to the man who dedicated their offerings to their deities or ancestors. In all the rituals that are performed by Tenggerese, the priest is the main actor. Tenggerese often call the name of the dukun as Rama. Every Tengger villages has dukun and the assistant of the dukun. dukun as Rama. Every Tengger villages has dukun and the assistant of the dukun."",""cultureId"":6,""status"":""PUBLISHED"",""statusKonservasi"":""TREATED"",""createdAt"":""2025-11-06T05:57:54.325Z"",""updatedAt"":""2025-11-15T15:02:07.225Z"",""artiSalamKhas"":""\""Om, (Brahmā, Visnū, Sivā), I wish for eternal well-being\"""",""statusPriorityDisplay"":""HIGH""}]","[]"
