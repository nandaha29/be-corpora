            "greetingMeaning": "We are Children of Panaraga People.",
            "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Panaraga is an area that has been etched into the collective memory of Javanese history, with its ancient identity as the region of Wĕngkĕr. This is mentioned in the books Pararaton and Negara Kartagama (D.J Brandes, 1897). Etymologically, the name Wĕngkĕr derives from the phrase wĕngonan angker 'haunted place', which refers to the concept of a place filled with mystical and supernatural aura (Moelyadi, 1986). In the Serat Centhini, canto 213, as translated by Stein Callenfels, there is a narrative that strengthens the historical legacy of Panaraga, which asserts that Wĕngkĕr held an important position in the history of classical Javanese civilization and became the undeniable historical identity of Panaraga.\n\n Geographically, the Panaraga sub-ethnic group refers to the area in the western part of East Java Province, now known as Ponorogo Regency, stretching from the western side of Mount Wilis to eastern side of Mount Lawu. According to Junghuhn's records (1855), numerous altars and terraces resembling worship sites were discovered, which were considered by ancient Javanese society as the dwelling places of gods and sacred crowns. Valentijn (1862) provided a more detailed description that the Panaraga region stretched from Pacitan Bay on the southern coast to Sumbang Village with approximately 150 families, extending two miles east of Mount Lawu, bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south and Lodaya to the east, with the Semangi River in Sangkulang Village serving as an important geographical marker and Mount Wilis as a natural boundary between Panaraga, Nganjuk and Kediri.\n\n In sociocultural context, the Dutch Resident in Madiun, Lucien Adam (1938), provided interesting anthropological notes regarding the characteristics of the Panaraga sub-ethnic community: \n\n The mystery of the origin of the Panaraga people has not been clearly revealed. Although they do not live in isolation from the surrounding areas, their types and characters differ from surrounding districts. People from Panaraga are more independent and self-confident, but also tough, brave, reckless, quick-tempered, and prefer to travel compared to average people in central Java.\n\n Adam's observations reveal the unique temperament of the Panaraga ethnic group, which differs from the general Javanese ethnic group, possessing an independent, brave, and highly adventurous spirit, represented by the figure of Warok as their sociocultural identity. Terminologically, Warok comes from the word waro'i or wirangi, which means 'already understands both physically and spiritually, whose actions are solely to help others', or from the word wewarah (Arabic: wara') which means 'to distance oneself from doubtful things', thus Warok can be interpreted as individual with supernatural power who uses their abilities for social good and holds a high status in Panaraga society. \n\n The existence of Warok cannot be separated from the art of reyog—both are like two sides of a coin united in the ethnic identity of Panaraga. The word reyog itself has various debated interpretations, ranging from the onomatopoeic hypothesis of the riyeg-riyeg bamboo sound to Mbah Wo Kucing's philosophical interpretation, which states REYOG as an acronym for five spiritual elements (R: rasa kidung (feeling of song), E: engwang sukma adiluhung (noble soul's essence), Y: Yang Widhi (The Divine), O: olah kridhaning Gusti (the Lord's creative act), G: gelar gumulung kĕrsaning Kang Maha Kuasa (the unfolding of the Almighty's will)), which means that reyog is not merely a performing art but a spiritual medium that connects humans with the divine dimension through artistic expression rich in the philosophical values of the Ponorogo community.\n\nRegardless of various etymological interpretations, the art of reyog was born from a complex socio-political context as a form of criticism by Warok Ki Ageng Kutu Suryaalam against the Majapahit government under the rule of King Brawijaya V, which was considered overly dominated by the queen consort. The phenomenon is symbolized in the form of singa barong or dadak merak—a tiger's head with a peacock's neck—which represents a subtle satire of a leadership that has lost its direction and power. \n\nPanaraga, with its historical and cultural identity, offers a unique depiction of cultural complexity within the mosaic of Javanese culture, featuring Warok as a central figure and reyog as an artistic expression rich in cultural and philosophical meaning. Therefore, this cultural heritage not only becomes a historical asset but also a living identity that must be continuously preserved by future generations as the proud ethnic identity of Panaraga.",

            "greetingMeaning": "\"Om, (Brahmā, Visnū, Sivā), I wish for eternal well-being\"",
            "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Tengger in Old Javanese means “highlands” (Gericke and Roorda, 1901:918), and thus the meaning of Wong Tengger would have mean persons who lived in highlands. In nowadays Java, Tengger no longer refer to that, but cover to “perch and sit above” (Hefner, 1985:25). Wong Tengger ‘Tengger People’ are indigenous community who resides and surrounds around the slope of Mountain Brahma (Bromo). The Tengger highlands locates to the northeast from Malang. There are three gates to reach there: (1) the first route is going to the north from Malang to Pasuruan or Purwodadi, we will find the main entrance Wonokitri village in Tosari district and going up to the Ngadiwono village. These regions well known as western side (brang kulon) of Tengger highlands; (2) the second route is heading to Probolinggo, we will reach the main entrance is Cemoro Lawang village (Ngadisari district) and directly overlooks mount Bromo and Tengger caldera. These gates are popularly known as eastern side (brang wetan) of Tengger highlands; (3) the third access has two kinds of gates: (1) heading to Tumpang, Malang then we will reach the Gubugklakah, and the main gate is Ngadas village; (2) heading to Lumajang, and climbing to Senduro, Ranupani. These regions are known as southern (brang kidul) of Tengger highlands.\n\nHong hulun Basuki Langgeng\n\nHong Hulun Basuki Langgeng is Tenggerese salutation. This formula consists of four words in Old Javenese: Oṅ or Om is often referred to mantra or formula praise; ṅhulun is the usual pronoun for the first person (Zoetmulder:1982). Whilst the rest of the words are still existed in modern Javanese, basuki means well-being, and laṅgĕṅ holds the meaning permanent. So, the Tenggerese salutation can be interpreted in the following: “Om, (Brahmā, Visnū, Sivā), I wish for eternal well-being”. Then, the receiver will reply: basuki laṅgĕṅ ‘well-being forever’. This salutation is given when someone visit their relatives by knocking the door or for maintaining social relationship among Tenggerese when they meet each other in market or climbing up to the Bromo.\n\nDukun Panḍita as divine actors \n\nIn order to maintain the divine relationship between the people of Tengger and their deities and ancestor, the role of dukun panḍita (priest of Tengger) is central (Sukmawan, 2022:14). In the rituals that they perform, the priest is acting like the middleman who mediate the realm world to divine world. By uttering their formulas (mantra) and mentioning the means of the ritual, the priest communicates to the unseen figures to the man who dedicated their offerings to their deities or ancestors. In all the rituals that are performed by Tenggerese, the priest is the main actor. Tenggerese often call the name of the dukun as Rama. Every Tengger villages has dukun and the assistant of the dukun. dukun as Rama. Every Tengger villages has dukun and the assistant of the dukun.",

        "greetingMeaning": "We are Children of Panaraga People.",
        "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Panaraga is an area that has been etched into the collective memory of Javanese history, with its ancient identity as the region of Wĕngkĕr. This is mentioned in the books Pararaton and Negara Kartagama (D.J Brandes, 1897). Etymologically, the name Wĕngkĕr derives from the phrase wĕngonan angker 'haunted place', which refers to the concept of a place filled with mystical and supernatural aura (Moelyadi, 1986). In the Serat Centhini, canto 213, as translated by Stein Callenfels, there is a narrative that strengthens the historical legacy of Panaraga, which asserts that Wĕngkĕr held an important position in the history of classical Javanese civilization and became the undeniable historical identity of Panaraga.\n\n Geographically, the Panaraga sub-ethnic group refers to the area in the western part of East Java Province, now known as Ponorogo Regency, stretching from the western side of Mount Wilis to eastern side of Mount Lawu. According to Junghuhn's records (1855), numerous altars and terraces resembling worship sites were discovered, which were considered by ancient Javanese society as the dwelling places of gods and sacred crowns. Valentijn (1862) provided a more detailed description that the Panaraga region stretched from Pacitan Bay on the southern coast to Sumbang Village with approximately 150 families, extending two miles east of Mount Lawu, bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south and Lodaya to the east, with the Semangi River in Sangkulang Village serving as an important geographical marker and Mount Wilis as a natural boundary between Panaraga, Nganjuk and Kediri.\n\n In sociocultural context, the Dutch Resident in Madiun, Lucien Adam (1938), provided interesting anthropological notes regarding the characteristics of the Panaraga sub-ethnic community: \n\n The mystery of the origin of the Panaraga people has not been clearly revealed. Although they do not live in isolation from the surrounding areas, their types and characters differ from surrounding districts. People from Panaraga are more independent and self-confident, but also tough, brave, reckless, quick-tempered, and prefer to travel compared to average people in central Java.\n\n Adam's observations reveal the unique temperament of the Panaraga ethnic group, which differs from the general Javanese ethnic group, possessing an independent, brave, and highly adventurous spirit, represented by the figure of Warok as their sociocultural identity. Terminologically, Warok comes from the word waro'i or wirangi, which means 'already understands both physically and spiritually, whose actions are solely to help others', or from the word wewarah (Arabic: wara') which means 'to distance oneself from doubtful things', thus Warok can be interpreted as individual with supernatural power who uses their abilities for social good and holds a high status in Panaraga society. \n\n The existence of Warok cannot be separated from the art of reyog—both are like two sides of a coin united in the ethnic identity of Panaraga. The word reyog itself has various debated interpretations, ranging from the onomatopoeic hypothesis of the riyeg-riyeg bamboo sound to Mbah Wo Kucing's philosophical interpretation, which states REYOG as an acronym for five spiritual elements (R: rasa kidung (feeling of song), E: engwang sukma adiluhung (noble soul's essence), Y: Yang Widhi (The Divine), O: olah kridhaning Gusti (the Lord's creative act), G: gelar gumulung kĕrsaning Kang Maha Kuasa (the unfolding of the Almighty's will)), which means that reyog is not merely a performing art but a spiritual medium that connects humans with the divine dimension through artistic expression rich in the philosophical values of the Ponorogo community.\n\nRegardless of various etymological interpretations, the art of reyog was born from a complex socio-political context as a form of criticism by Warok Ki Ageng Kutu Suryaalam against the Majapahit government under the rule of King Brawijaya V, which was considered overly dominated by the queen consort. The phenomenon is symbolized in the form of singa barong or dadak merak—a tiger's head with a peacock's neck—which represents a subtle satire of a leadership that has lost its direction and power. \n\nPanaraga, with its historical and cultural identity, offers a unique depiction of cultural complexity within the mosaic of Javanese culture, featuring Warok as a central figure and reyog as an artistic expression rich in cultural and philosophical meaning. Therefore, this cultural heritage not only becomes a historical asset but also a living identity that must be continuously preserved by future generations as the proud ethnic identity of Panaraga.",

        "greetingMeaning": "\"Om, (Brahmā, Visnū, Sivā), I wish for eternal well-being\"",
        "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Tengger in Old Javanese means “highlands” (Gericke and Roorda, 1901:918), and thus the meaning of Wong Tengger would have mean persons who lived in highlands. In nowadays Java, Tengger no longer refer to that, but cover to “perch and sit above” (Hefner, 1985:25). Wong Tengger ‘Tengger People’ are indigenous community who resides and surrounds around the slope of Mountain Brahma (Bromo). The Tengger highlands locates to the northeast from Malang. There are three gates to reach there: (1) the first route is going to the north from Malang to Pasuruan or Purwodadi, we will find the main entrance Wonokitri village in Tosari district and going up to the Ngadiwono village. These regions well known as western side (brang kulon) of Tengger highlands; (2) the second route is heading to Probolinggo, we will reach the main entrance is Cemoro Lawang village (Ngadisari district) and directly overlooks mount Bromo and Tengger caldera. These gates are popularly known as eastern side (brang wetan) of Tengger highlands; (3) the third access has two kinds of gates: (1) heading to Tumpang, Malang then we will reach the Gubugklakah, and the main gate is Ngadas village; (2) heading to Lumajang, and climbing to Senduro, Ranupani. These regions are known as southern (brang kidul) of Tengger highlands.\n\nHong hulun Basuki Langgeng\n\nHong Hulun Basuki Langgeng is Tenggerese salutation. This formula consists of four words in Old Javenese: Oṅ or Om is often referred to mantra or formula praise; ṅhulun is the usual pronoun for the first person (Zoetmulder:1982). Whilst the rest of the words are still existed in modern Javanese, basuki means well-being, and laṅgĕṅ holds the meaning permanent. So, the Tenggerese salutation can be interpreted in the following: “Om, (Brahmā, Visnū, Sivā), I wish for eternal well-being”. Then, the receiver will reply: basuki laṅgĕṅ ‘well-being forever’. This salutation is given when someone visit their relatives by knocking the door or for maintaining social relationship among Tenggerese when they meet each other in market or climbing up to the Bromo.\n\nDukun Panḍita as divine actors \n\nIn order to maintain the divine relationship between the people of Tengger and their deities and ancestor, the role of dukun panḍita (priest of Tengger) is central (Sukmawan, 2022:14). In the rituals that they perform, the priest is acting like the middleman who mediate the realm world to divine world. By uttering their formulas (mantra) and mentioning the means of the ritual, the priest communicates to the unseen figures to the man who dedicated their offerings to their deities or ancestors. In all the rituals that are performed by Tenggerese, the priest is the main actor. Tenggerese often call the name of the dukun as Rama. Every Tengger villages has dukun and the assistant of the dukun. dukun as Rama. Every Tengger villages has dukun and the assistant of the dukun.",

          "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Tengger in Old Javanese means “highlands” (Gericke and Roorda, 1901:918), and thus the meaning of Wong Tengger would have mean persons who lived in highlands. In nowadays Java, Tengger no longer refer to that, but cover to “perch and sit above” (Hefner, 1985:25). Wong Tengger ‘Tengger People’ are indigenous community who resides and surrounds around the slope of Mountain Brahma (Bromo). The Tengger highlands locates to the northeast from Malang. There are three gates to reach there: (1) the first route is going to the north from Malang to Pasuruan or Purwodadi, we will find the main entrance Wonokitri village in Tosari district and going up to the Ngadiwono village. These regions well known as western side (brang kulon) of Tengger highlands; (2) the second route is heading to Probolinggo, we will reach the main entrance is Cemoro Lawang village (Ngadisari district) and directly overlooks mount Bromo and Tengger caldera. These gates are popularly known as eastern side (brang wetan) of Tengger highlands; (3) the third access has two kinds of gates: (1) heading to Tumpang, Malang then we will reach the Gubugklakah, and the main gate is Ngadas village; (2) heading to Lumajang, and climbing to Senduro, Ranupani. These regions are known as southern (brang kidul) of Tengger highlands.\n\nHong hulun Basuki Langgeng\n\nHong Hulun Basuki Langgeng is Tenggerese salutation. This formula consists of four words in Old Javenese: Oṅ or Om is often referred to mantra or formula praise; ṅhulun is the usual pronoun for the first person (Zoetmulder:1982). Whilst the rest of the words are still existed in modern Javanese, basuki means well-being, and laṅgĕṅ holds the meaning permanent. So, the Tenggerese salutation can be interpreted in the following: “Om, (Brahmā, Visnū, Sivā), I wish for eternal well-being”. Then, the receiver will reply: basuki laṅgĕṅ ‘well-being forever’. This salutation is given when someone visit their relatives by knocking the door or for maintaining social relationship among Tenggerese when they meet each other in market or climbing up to the Bromo.\n\nDukun Panḍita as divine actors \n\nIn order to maintain the divine relationship between the people of Tengger and their deities and ancestor, the role of dukun panḍita (priest of Tengger) is central (Sukmawan, 2022:14). In the rituals that they perform, the priest is acting like the middleman who mediate the realm world to divine world. By uttering their formulas (mantra) and mentioning the means of the ritual, the priest communicates to the unseen figures to the man who dedicated their offerings to their deities or ancestors. In all the rituals that are performed by Tenggerese, the priest is the main actor. Tenggerese often call the name of the dukun as Rama. Every Tengger villages has dukun and the assistant of the dukun. dukun as Rama. Every Tengger villages has dukun and the assistant of the dukun.",

            "culturalMeaning": "Its precise etymology unclear, the barikan is identified by modern Tengger as a rite of balikan or the \"turning back\" of evil from the village. In some communities barikan occurs every thirty-five days, but in others it takes place only after eclipses, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions. The liturgy is celebrated at the village chief's house. Women bring baskets of cooked food to the front steps of the house. While village officials act as \"witnesses,\" the priest blesses the food and returns half to the women. The half which remains is used to make a communion meal for the priest and village officials. The half taken home is eaten by members of each household, who thereby share in its blessing. A small portion of the home food is in addition made into tamping earth offerings, set out by each family around the house and fields. (Hefner, 1985: 123). \"Slametan Barian yang dilaksanakan setiap bulan sekali pada hari Jumat pasaran Legi dilaksanakan dalam rangka meminta perlindungan dan keselamatan kosmis.\" (Sukmawan, 2018:88).

Barikan dilaksanakan di rumah pemimpin adat dan dipimpin dukun, dengan sajian makanan yang dibagi dua: sebagian disantap dalam kebersamaan ritual, sisanya dibawa pulang sebagai sesaji di pekarangan dan ladang. Selain sebagai proteksi spiritual, barikan juga dimaknai sebagai ungkapan syukur dan perekat solidaritas sosial.\n",

Grounded in the belief in the relationship between humans, nature, ancestors, and supernatural forces, the rite serves to restore disrupted harmony. Barikan is held at customary leader's residence and led by the village dukun (shaman). The food offerings in this rite are split to two: one portion to be consumed together during the ritual gathering, and another taken home as offerings in yards and fields.

Penggunaannya meluas dari ritus sakral yang terikat penanggalan adat menjadi praktik yang lebih fleksibel, misalnya pada awal musim tanam atau pembukaan fasilitas umum.

Its application has expanded from sacred rites aligned with the traditional calendar to more flexible occasions, such as the beginning of the planting season or the inauguration of public facilities.

The ceremony is held at the village’s sacred site with a buffalo as the offering as a symbolic vehicle to the afterlife. Its purpose is to cleanse the village from disturbances of the spirits and to purify the souls to be sent to their original, perfect realm, namely Nirvana.

In nowadays Java, Tengger no longer refer to that, but cover to “perch and sit above” (Hefner, 1985:25). Wong Tengger ‘Tengger People’ are indigenous community who resides and surrounds around the slope of Mountain Brahma (Bromo). The Tengger highlands locates to the northeast from Malang. There are three gates to reach there: (1) the first route is going to the north from Malang to Pasuruan or Purwodadi, we will find the main entrance Wonokitri village in Tosari district and going up to the Ngadiwono village. These regions well known as western side (brang kulon) of Tengger highlands; (2) the second route is heading to Probolinggo, we will reach the main entrance is Cemoro Lawang village (Ngadisari district) and directly overlooks mount Bromo and Tengger caldera. These gates are popularly known as eastern side (brang wetan) of Tengger highlands; (3) the third access has two kinds of gates: (1) heading to Tumpang, Malang then we will reach the Gubugklakah, and the main gate is Ngadas village; (2) heading to Lumajang, and climbing to Senduro, Ranupani.

This formula consists of four words in Old Javenese: Oṅ or Om is often referred to mantra or formula praise; ṅhulun is the usual pronoun for the first person (Zoetmulder:1982). Whilst the rest of the words are still existed in modern Javanese, basuki means well-being, and laṅgĕṅ holds the meaning permanent. So, the Tenggerese salutation can be interpreted in the following: “Om, (Brahmā, Visnū, Sivā), I wish for eternal well-being”. Then, the receiver will reply: basuki laṅgĕṅ ‘well-being forever’. This salutation is given when someone visit their relatives by knocking the door or for maintaining social relationship among Tenggerese when they meet each other in market or climbing up to the Bromo.\n\nDukun Panḍita as divine actors \n\nIn order to maintain the divine relationship between the people of Tengger and their deities and ancestor, the role of dukun panḍita (priest of Tengger) is central (Sukmawan, 2022:14).

            "translation": "Among-among is a birth rite of the Tengger community performed when a baby reaches 44 days old as a form of protection from evil spirits. The term derives from the word among (“to care for, to nurture”), and in reduplicated form refers to a special slametan or feast to show gratitude for children. The ritual includes the recitation of protective mantras at each stage of the baby’s development, along with prohibitions imposed on the mother, such as avoidance of consuming sea fish, spicy food, and cucumbers and recommendation of consuming ranti,sawijo, and tetirem leaves.

Semua varian menandai masa transisi awal kehidupan melalui doa, persembahan, dan kebersamaan keluarga, dengan fungsi menjaga keselamatan bayi, menolak gangguan gaib, serta mempererat relasi sosial.

All these variants mark the transitional period of early life through prayer, offerings, and family gatherings, serving to safeguard the infant’s well-being, ward off supernatural disturbances, and strengthen social bonds. In this way, among-among represents a local expression of the broader Javanese tradition of celebrating new life.",

Dalam pandangan masyarakat Tengger, meskipun sering disamakan dengan nyewu oleh pihak luar, entas-entas memiliki struktur liturgi yang jauh lebih kompleks dan mendalam. \"The Tengger entas-entas serves not simply to commemorate the dead, but to aid in their passage to heaven... Its prayers are the longest, its offerings the most abundant, and its ritual the most powerful of any household ritual performed by a priest\" (Hefner, 1989:163). Dalam tradisi kolonial, ritual ini dikenal sebagai sedekah entas-entas atau sedekah njèwoe, dan sering dilakukan untuk banyak arwah sekaligus, diwakili oleh simbol roh bernama pètro yang terbuat dari berbagai daun dan janur kuning (Jasper, 1928:74). Upacara ini dimaksudkan untuk menyucikan roh orang yang telah meninggal dunia pada hari ke-1000 agar masuk surga (Sutarto, 2006:8). \"Entas-entas merupakan upacara terakhir untuk orang meninggal. Dalam pelaksanaannya, upacara ini membutuhkan banyak orang untuk bethek-sinoman.\" (Sukmawan, 2020:19).",

            "variant": "Dalam bahasa Jawa Timur sehari-hari, entas dan bentukannya seperti mentas mengalami perluasan makna yang bersifat kontekstual. Entas dipakai untuk ‘mengangkat’ atau ‘mengambil dari tempat semula’, sedangkan mentas lazim digunakan untuk aktivitas yang terkait air, misalnya “mentas saka kolam” (naik dari kolam) atau “mentas adus” (selesai mandi), dengan makna dasar ‘keluar dari’ atau ‘terlepas dari suatu keadaan’. Secara semantis, keduanya berpijak pada konsep ‘pembebasan’ atau ‘pemindahan’, sebagaimana tercermin dalam makna ritual entas-entas. Di Pacitan, entas-entas berarti mengumpulkan padi dari tiap rumah sebagai bagian pesta panen, sedangkan dalam tradisi Jawa istilah nyewu kerap diasosiasikan sebagai padanan ritual, meski berbeda dalam struktur dan simbolik. Variasi ini menunjukkan bahwa entas tidak hanya hidup dalam ranah spiritual, tetapi juga membumi dalam praktik keseharian masyarakat Jawa Timur.",
            "variantTranslations": "In East Javanese collocation, entas and its derivative forms, such as mentas, have undergone a contextual expansion of meaning. Entas generally refers to ‘lifting’ or ‘taking from its original place,’ while mentas is commonly used in water-related contexts, for example, “mentas saka kolam” (getting out of a pool) or “mentas adus” (finishing a bath), carrying the basic sense of ‘getting out of’ or ‘being released from’ a situation. Semantically, both terms are grounded in the concepts of ‘liberation’ or ‘transfer,’ as reflected in the entas-entas ritual. In Pacitan, entas-entas involves collecting rice from each household as part of a harvest festival, whereas in broader Javanese tradition, the term nyewu is often considered a ritual equivalent, though differing in structure and symbolism. This variation demonstrates that entas exists not only in the spiritual sphere but is also embedded in the everyday practices of East Javanese society.",

          "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Tengger in Old Javanese means “highlands” (Gericke and Roorda, 1901:918), and thus the meaning of Wong Tengger would have mean persons who lived in highlands. In nowadays Java, Tengger no longer refer to that, but cover to “perch and sit above” (Hefner, 1985:25). Wong Tengger ‘Tengger People’ are indigenous community who resides and surrounds around the slope of Mountain Brahma (Bromo). The Tengger highlands locates to the northeast from Malang. There are three gates to reach there: (1) the first route is going to the north from Malang to Pasuruan or Purwodadi, we will find the main entrance Wonokitri village in Tosari district and going up to the Ngadiwono village. These regions well known as western side (brang kulon) of Tengger highlands; (2) the second route is heading to Probolinggo, we will reach the main entrance is Cemoro Lawang village (Ngadisari district) and directly overlooks mount Bromo and Tengger caldera. These gates are popularly known as eastern side (brang wetan) of Tengger highlands; (3) the third access has two kinds of gates: (1) heading to Tumpang, Malang then we will reach the Gubugklakah, and the main gate is Ngadas village; (2) heading to Lumajang, and climbing to Senduro, Ranupani. These regions are known as southern (brang kidul) of Tengger highlands.\n\nHong hulun Basuki Langgeng\n\nHong Hulun Basuki Langgeng is Tenggerese salutation. This formula consists of four words in Old Javenese: Oṅ or Om is often referred to mantra or formula praise; ṅhulun is the usual pronoun for the first person (Zoetmulder:1982). Whilst the rest of the words are still existed in modern Javanese, basuki means well-being, and laṅgĕṅ holds the meaning permanent. So, the Tenggerese salutation can be interpreted in the following: “Om, (Brahmā, Visnū, Sivā), I wish for eternal well-being”. Then, the receiver will reply: basuki laṅgĕṅ ‘well-being forever’. This salutation is given when someone visit their relatives by knocking the door or for maintaining social relationship among Tenggerese when they meet each other in market or climbing up to the Bromo.\n\nDukun Panḍita as divine actors \n\nIn order to maintain the divine relationship between the people of Tengger and their deities and ancestor, the role of dukun panḍita (priest of Tengger) is central (Sukmawan, 2022:14). In the rituals that they perform, the priest is acting like the middleman who mediate the realm world to divine world. By uttering their formulas (mantra) and mentioning the means of the ritual, the priest communicates to the unseen figures to the man who dedicated their offerings to their deities or ancestors. In all the rituals that are performed by Tenggerese, the priest is the main actor. Tenggerese often call the name of the dukun as Rama. Every Tengger villages has dukun and the assistant of the dukun. dukun as Rama. Every Tengger villages has dukun and the assistant of the dukun.",

          "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Tengger in Old Javanese means “highlands” (Gericke and Roorda, 1901:918), and thus the meaning of Wong Tengger would have mean persons who lived in highlands. In nowadays Java, Tengger no longer refer to that, but cover to “perch and sit above” (Hefner, 1985:25). Wong Tengger ‘Tengger People’ are indigenous community who resides and surrounds around the slope of Mountain Brahma (Bromo). The Tengger highlands locates to the northeast from Malang. There are three gates to reach there: (1) the first route is going to the north from Malang to Pasuruan or Purwodadi, we will find the main entrance Wonokitri village in Tosari district and going up to the Ngadiwono village. These regions well known as western side (brang kulon) of Tengger highlands; (2) the second route is heading to Probolinggo, we will reach the main entrance is Cemoro Lawang village (Ngadisari district) and directly overlooks mount Bromo and Tengger caldera. These gates are popularly known as eastern side (brang wetan) of Tengger highlands; (3) the third access has two kinds of gates: (1) heading to Tumpang, Malang then we will reach the Gubugklakah, and the main gate is Ngadas village; (2) heading to Lumajang, and climbing to Senduro, Ranupani. These regions are known as southern (brang kidul) of Tengger highlands.\n\nHong hulun Basuki Langgeng\n\nHong Hulun Basuki Langgeng is Tenggerese salutation. This formula consists of four words in Old Javenese: Oṅ or Om is often referred to mantra or formula praise; ṅhulun is the usual pronoun for the first person (Zoetmulder:1982). Whilst the rest of the words are still existed in modern Javanese, basuki means well-being, and laṅgĕṅ holds the meaning permanent. So, the Tenggerese salutation can be interpreted in the following: “Om, (Brahmā, Visnū, Sivā), I wish for eternal well-being”. Then, the receiver will reply: basuki laṅgĕṅ ‘well-being forever’. This salutation is given when someone visit their relatives by knocking the door or for maintaining social relationship among Tenggerese when they meet each other in market or climbing up to the Bromo.\n\nDukun Panḍita as divine actors \n\nIn order to maintain the divine relationship between the people of Tengger and their deities and ancestor, the role of dukun panḍita (priest of Tengger) is central (Sukmawan, 2022:14). In the rituals that they perform, the priest is acting like the middleman who mediate the realm world to divine world. By uttering their formulas (mantra) and mentioning the means of the ritual, the priest communicates to the unseen figures to the man who dedicated their offerings to their deities or ancestors. In all the rituals that are performed by Tenggerese, the priest is the main actor. Tenggerese often call the name of the dukun as Rama. Every Tengger villages has dukun and the assistant of the dukun. dukun as Rama. Every Tengger villages has dukun and the assistant of the dukun.",

The actual ritual service—a more or less standard invocation of the gods—lasts only about five minutes. The remainder of the evening is devoted to the meal...

Dalam praktik Hindu dan Buddha, puja tetap berarti sembahyang, tetapi tanpa dimensi sosial-komunal sebagaimana di Tengger. Pujan juga telah bertransformasi dari perjamuan besar yang terbuka menjadi doa simbolik terbatas, meski tetap menuntut kontribusi kolektif.

Among Tengger people, pujan has evolved into a distinctive collective ritual tied to the cycle of time and the village’s social structure, a practice unique to this community and not found elsewhere in Java. While related to selametan or kenduren, pujan differs in its calendar, the role of the village shaman, and the more structured nature of its offerings. In Hindu and Buddhist contexts, puja continues to signify prayer, though without the socio-communal dimension characteristic of Tengger. Over time, pujan has shifted from a large, open-air feast to a more limited, symbolic form of prayer, while still requiring collective contributions. These transformations reflect adaptation to modernity, preserving both its core meaning of divine reverence and the maintenance of sustainable village harmony.",

          "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Panaraga is an area that has been etched into the collective memory of Javanese history, with its ancient identity as the region of Wĕngkĕr. This is mentioned in the books Pararaton and Negara Kartagama (D.J Brandes, 1897). Etymologically, the name Wĕngkĕr derives from the phrase wĕngonan angker 'haunted place', which refers to the concept of a place filled with mystical and supernatural aura (Moelyadi, 1986). In the Serat Centhini, canto 213, as translated by Stein Callenfels, there is a narrative that strengthens the historical legacy of Panaraga, which asserts that Wĕngkĕr held an important position in the history of classical Javanese civilization and became the undeniable historical identity of Panaraga.\n\n Geographically, the Panaraga sub-ethnic group refers to the area in the western part of East Java Province, now known as Ponorogo Regency, stretching from the western side of Mount Wilis to eastern side of Mount Lawu. According to Junghuhn's records (1855), numerous altars and terraces resembling worship sites were discovered, which were considered by ancient Javanese society as the dwelling places of gods and sacred crowns. Valentijn (1862) provided a more detailed description that the Panaraga region stretched from Pacitan Bay on the southern coast to Sumbang Village with approximately 150 families, extending two miles east of Mount Lawu, bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south and Lodaya to the east, with the Semangi River in Sangkulang Village serving as an important geographical marker and Mount Wilis as a natural boundary between Panaraga, Nganjuk and Kediri.\n\n In sociocultural context, the Dutch Resident in Madiun, Lucien Adam (1938), provided interesting anthropological notes regarding the characteristics of the Panaraga sub-ethnic community: \n\n The mystery of the origin of the Panaraga people has not been clearly revealed. Although they do not live in isolation from the surrounding areas, their types and characters differ from surrounding districts. People from Panaraga are more independent and self-confident, but also tough, brave, reckless, quick-tempered, and prefer to travel compared to average people in central Java.\n\n Adam's observations reveal the unique temperament of the Panaraga ethnic group, which differs from the general Javanese ethnic group, possessing an independent, brave, and highly adventurous spirit, represented by the figure of Warok as their sociocultural identity. Terminologically, Warok comes from the word waro'i or wirangi, which means 'already understands both physically and spiritually, whose actions are solely to help others', or from the word wewarah (Arabic: wara') which means 'to distance oneself from doubtful things', thus Warok can be interpreted as individual with supernatural power who uses their abilities for social good and holds a high status in Panaraga society. \n\n The existence of Warok cannot be separated from the art of reyog—both are like two sides of a coin united in the ethnic identity of Panaraga. The word reyog itself has various debated interpretations, ranging from the onomatopoeic hypothesis of the riyeg-riyeg bamboo sound to Mbah Wo Kucing's philosophical interpretation, which states REYOG as an acronym for five spiritual elements (R: rasa kidung (feeling of song), E: engwang sukma adiluhung (noble soul's essence), Y: Yang Widhi (The Divine), O: olah kridhaning Gusti (the Lord's creative act), G: gelar gumulung kĕrsaning Kang Maha Kuasa (the unfolding of the Almighty's will)), which means that reyog is not merely a performing art but a spiritual medium that connects humans with the divine dimension through artistic expression rich in the philosophical values of the Ponorogo community.\n\nRegardless of various etymological interpretations, the art of reyog was born from a complex socio-political context as a form of criticism by Warok Ki Ageng Kutu Suryaalam against the Majapahit government under the rule of King Brawijaya V, which was considered overly dominated by the queen consort. The phenomenon is symbolized in the form of singa barong or dadak merak—a tiger's head with a peacock's neck—which represents a subtle satire of a leadership that has lost its direction and power. \n\nPanaraga, with its historical and cultural identity, offers a unique depiction of cultural complexity within the mosaic of Javanese culture, featuring Warok as a central figure and reyog as an artistic expression rich in cultural and philosophical meaning. Therefore, this cultural heritage not only becomes a historical asset but also a living identity that must be continuously preserved by future generations as the proud ethnic identity of Panaraga.",

          "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Panaraga is an area that has been etched into the collective memory of Javanese history, with its ancient identity as the region of Wĕngkĕr. This is mentioned in the books Pararaton and Negara Kartagama (D.J Brandes, 1897). Etymologically, the name Wĕngkĕr derives from the phrase wĕngonan angker 'haunted place', which refers to the concept of a place filled with mystical and supernatural aura (Moelyadi, 1986). In the Serat Centhini, canto 213, as translated by Stein Callenfels, there is a narrative that strengthens the historical legacy of Panaraga, which asserts that Wĕngkĕr held an important position in the history of classical Javanese civilization and became the undeniable historical identity of Panaraga.\n\n Geographically, the Panaraga sub-ethnic group refers to the area in the western part of East Java Province, now known as Ponorogo Regency, stretching from the western side of Mount Wilis to eastern side of Mount Lawu. According to Junghuhn's records (1855), numerous altars and terraces resembling worship sites were discovered, which were considered by ancient Javanese society as the dwelling places of gods and sacred crowns. Valentijn (1862) provided a more detailed description that the Panaraga region stretched from Pacitan Bay on the southern coast to Sumbang Village with approximately 150 families, extending two miles east of Mount Lawu, bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south and Lodaya to the east, with the Semangi River in Sangkulang Village serving as an important geographical marker and Mount Wilis as a natural boundary between Panaraga, Nganjuk and Kediri.\n\n In sociocultural context, the Dutch Resident in Madiun, Lucien Adam (1938), provided interesting anthropological notes regarding the characteristics of the Panaraga sub-ethnic community: \n\n The mystery of the origin of the Panaraga people has not been clearly revealed. Although they do not live in isolation from the surrounding areas, their types and characters differ from surrounding districts. People from Panaraga are more independent and self-confident, but also tough, brave, reckless, quick-tempered, and prefer to travel compared to average people in central Java.\n\n Adam's observations reveal the unique temperament of the Panaraga ethnic group, which differs from the general Javanese ethnic group, possessing an independent, brave, and highly adventurous spirit, represented by the figure of Warok as their sociocultural identity. Terminologically, Warok comes from the word waro'i or wirangi, which means 'already understands both physically and spiritually, whose actions are solely to help others', or from the word wewarah (Arabic: wara') which means 'to distance oneself from doubtful things', thus Warok can be interpreted as individual with supernatural power who uses their abilities for social good and holds a high status in Panaraga society. \n\n The existence of Warok cannot be separated from the art of reyog—both are like two sides of a coin united in the ethnic identity of Panaraga. The word reyog itself has various debated interpretations, ranging from the onomatopoeic hypothesis of the riyeg-riyeg bamboo sound to Mbah Wo Kucing's philosophical interpretation, which states REYOG as an acronym for five spiritual elements (R: rasa kidung (feeling of song), E: engwang sukma adiluhung (noble soul's essence), Y: Yang Widhi (The Divine), O: olah kridhaning Gusti (the Lord's creative act), G: gelar gumulung kĕrsaning Kang Maha Kuasa (the unfolding of the Almighty's will)), which means that reyog is not merely a performing art but a spiritual medium that connects humans with the divine dimension through artistic expression rich in the philosophical values of the Ponorogo community.\n\nRegardless of various etymological interpretations, the art of reyog was born from a complex socio-political context as a form of criticism by Warok Ki Ageng Kutu Suryaalam against the Majapahit government under the rule of King Brawijaya V, which was considered overly dominated by the queen consort. The phenomenon is symbolized in the form of singa barong or dadak merak—a tiger's head with a peacock's neck—which represents a subtle satire of a leadership that has lost its direction and power. \n\nPanaraga, with its historical and cultural identity, offers a unique depiction of cultural complexity within the mosaic of Javanese culture, featuring Warok as a central figure and reyog as an artistic expression rich in cultural and philosophical meaning. Therefore, this cultural heritage not only becomes a historical asset but also a living identity that must be continuously preserved by future generations as the proud ethnic identity of Panaraga.",

Oleh karena itu, keberadaan warok sangat dihormati sehingga seringkali mereka dimintai bantuan spiritual oleh masyarakat dalam berbagai aktivitas seperti hajatan, pagelaran, maupun ritual adat tradisi. Menurut Poerwowidjoyo (1990) warok berasal dari kata waro’i atau wirangi (dalam bahasa Jawa) yang berarti wis pana wis ngerti banget, marang agal alus lahir batin, tumindake mung kangge tetulung marang liyan ‘sudah paham, terhadap lahir dan batin, tindakannya hanya untuk menolong orang lain’. Berdasarkan pengertian tersebut, dapat disimpulkan bahwa seorang warok memiliki kemampuan supranatural atau kesaktian yang di gunakan untuk menolong sesama. Pendapat lain mengenai istilah waro berasal dari kata wewarah. Kata wewarah dari bahasa arab wara yang berarti ‘menjauhkan diri dari segala syubhat’. Wewarah seringkali dimaknai wong kang sugih wewarah ‘orang yang kaya pentunjuk’. Seperti disinggung dalam banyak literatur, nilai-nilai filosofis sangat kental dalam kesenian Reog, termasuk konsep nama warok itu sendiri. ",
            "commonMeaning": "Warok merujuk pada seorang tokoh atau individu yang dianggap sakti atau memiliki kekuatan magis dalam tradisi Ponorogo. Warok sering kali diidentifikasi dengan sifat kepemimpinan yang kuat, kebijaksanaan, dan kemampuan melindungi masyarakat.",
            "translation": "Warok refers to a figure in Ponorogo tradition believed to possess spiritual power or supernatural abilities. A Warok is often associated with strength, wisdom, moral authority, and the responsibility to protect and guide the community.",

          "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Panaraga is an area that has been etched into the collective memory of Javanese history, with its ancient identity as the region of Wĕngkĕr. This is mentioned in the books Pararaton and Negara Kartagama (D.J Brandes, 1897). Etymologically, the name Wĕngkĕr derives from the phrase wĕngonan angker 'haunted place', which refers to the concept of a place filled with mystical and supernatural aura (Moelyadi, 1986). In the Serat Centhini, canto 213, as translated by Stein Callenfels, there is a narrative that strengthens the historical legacy of Panaraga, which asserts that Wĕngkĕr held an important position in the history of classical Javanese civilization and became the undeniable historical identity of Panaraga.\n\n Geographically, the Panaraga sub-ethnic group refers to the area in the western part of East Java Province, now known as Ponorogo Regency, stretching from the western side of Mount Wilis to eastern side of Mount Lawu. According to Junghuhn's records (1855), numerous altars and terraces resembling worship sites were discovered, which were considered by ancient Javanese society as the dwelling places of gods and sacred crowns. Valentijn (1862) provided a more detailed description that the Panaraga region stretched from Pacitan Bay on the southern coast to Sumbang Village with approximately 150 families, extending two miles east of Mount Lawu, bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south and Lodaya to the east, with the Semangi River in Sangkulang Village serving as an important geographical marker and Mount Wilis as a natural boundary between Panaraga, Nganjuk and Kediri.\n\n In sociocultural context, the Dutch Resident in Madiun, Lucien Adam (1938), provided interesting anthropological notes regarding the characteristics of the Panaraga sub-ethnic community: \n\n The mystery of the origin of the Panaraga people has not been clearly revealed. Although they do not live in isolation from the surrounding areas, their types and characters differ from surrounding districts. People from Panaraga are more independent and self-confident, but also tough, brave, reckless, quick-tempered, and prefer to travel compared to average people in central Java.\n\n Adam's observations reveal the unique temperament of the Panaraga ethnic group, which differs from the general Javanese ethnic group, possessing an independent, brave, and highly adventurous spirit, represented by the figure of Warok as their sociocultural identity. Terminologically, Warok comes from the word waro'i or wirangi, which means 'already understands both physically and spiritually, whose actions are solely to help others', or from the word wewarah (Arabic: wara') which means 'to distance oneself from doubtful things', thus Warok can be interpreted as individual with supernatural power who uses their abilities for social good and holds a high status in Panaraga society. \n\n The existence of Warok cannot be separated from the art of reyog—both are like two sides of a coin united in the ethnic identity of Panaraga. The word reyog itself has various debated interpretations, ranging from the onomatopoeic hypothesis of the riyeg-riyeg bamboo sound to Mbah Wo Kucing's philosophical interpretation, which states REYOG as an acronym for five spiritual elements (R: rasa kidung (feeling of song), E: engwang sukma adiluhung (noble soul's essence), Y: Yang Widhi (The Divine), O: olah kridhaning Gusti (the Lord's creative act), G: gelar gumulung kĕrsaning Kang Maha Kuasa (the unfolding of the Almighty's will)), which means that reyog is not merely a performing art but a spiritual medium that connects humans with the divine dimension through artistic expression rich in the philosophical values of the Ponorogo community.\n\nRegardless of various etymological interpretations, the art of reyog was born from a complex socio-political context as a form of criticism by Warok Ki Ageng Kutu Suryaalam against the Majapahit government under the rule of King Brawijaya V, which was considered overly dominated by the queen consort. The phenomenon is symbolized in the form of singa barong or dadak merak—a tiger's head with a peacock's neck—which represents a subtle satire of a leadership that has lost its direction and power. \n\nPanaraga, with its historical and cultural identity, offers a unique depiction of cultural complexity within the mosaic of Javanese culture, featuring Warok as a central figure and reyog as an artistic expression rich in cultural and philosophical meaning. Therefore, this cultural heritage not only becomes a historical asset but also a living identity that must be continuously preserved by future generations as the proud ethnic identity of Panaraga.",

            "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Tengger in Old Javanese means “highlands” (Gericke and Roorda, 1901:918), and thus the meaning of Wong Tengger would have mean persons who lived in highlands. In nowadays Java, Tengger no longer refer to that, but cover to “perch and sit above” (Hefner, 1985:25). Wong Tengger ‘Tengger People’ are indigenous community who resides and surrounds around the slope of Mountain Brahma (Bromo). The Tengger highlands locates to the northeast from Malang. There are three gates to reach there: (1) the first route is going to the north from Malang to Pasuruan or Purwodadi, we will find the main entrance Wonokitri village in Tosari district and going up to the Ngadiwono village. These regions well known as western side (brang kulon) of Tengger highlands; (2) the second route is heading to Probolinggo, we will reach the main entrance is Cemoro Lawang village (Ngadisari district) and directly overlooks mount Bromo and Tengger caldera. These gates are popularly known as eastern side (brang wetan) of Tengger highlands; (3) the third access has two kinds of gates: (1) heading to Tumpang, Malang then we will reach the Gubugklakah, and the main gate is Ngadas village; (2) heading to Lumajang, and climbing to Senduro, Ranupani. These regions are known as southern (brang kidul) of Tengger highlands.\n\nHong hulun Basuki Langgeng\n\nHong Hulun Basuki Langgeng is Tenggerese salutation. This formula consists of four words in Old Javenese: Oṅ or Om is often referred to mantra or formula praise; ṅhulun is the usual pronoun for the first person (Zoetmulder:1982). Whilst the rest of the words are still existed in modern Javanese, basuki means well-being, and laṅgĕṅ holds the meaning permanent. So, the Tenggerese salutation can be interpreted in the following: “Om, (Brahmā, Visnū, Sivā), I wish for eternal well-being”. Then, the receiver will reply: basuki laṅgĕṅ ‘well-being forever’. This salutation is given when someone visit their relatives by knocking the door or for maintaining social relationship among Tenggerese when they meet each other in market or climbing up to the Bromo.\n\nDukun Panḍita as divine actors \n\nIn order to maintain the divine relationship between the people of Tengger and their deities and ancestor, the role of dukun panḍita (priest of Tengger) is central (Sukmawan, 2022:14). In the rituals that they perform, the priest is acting like the middleman who mediate the realm world to divine world. By uttering their formulas (mantra) and mentioning the means of the ritual, the priest communicates to the unseen figures to the man who dedicated their offerings to their deities or ancestors. In all the rituals that are performed by Tenggerese, the priest is the main actor. Tenggerese often call the name of the dukun as Rama. Every Tengger villages has dukun and the assistant of the dukun. dukun as Rama. Every Tengger villages has dukun and the assistant of the dukun.",

        "culturalMeaning": "Its precise etymology unclear, the barikan is identified by modern Tengger as a rite of balikan or the \"turning back\" of evil from the village. In some communities barikan occurs every thirty-five days, but in others it takes place only after eclipses, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions. The liturgy is celebrated at the village chief's house. Women bring baskets of cooked food to the front steps of the house. While village officials act as \"witnesses,\" the priest blesses the food and returns half to the women. The half which remains is used to make a communion meal for the priest and village officials. The half taken home is eaten by members of each household, who thereby share in its blessing. A small portion of the home food is in addition made into tamping earth offerings, set out by each family around the house and fields. (Hefner, 1985: 123). \"Slametan Barian yang dilaksanakan setiap bulan sekali pada hari Jumat pasaran Legi dilaksanakan dalam rangka meminta perlindungan dan keselamatan kosmis.\" (Sukmawan, 2018:88).

In local practice, barikan encompasses a range of communal rituals that express gratitude, honor ancestors, or protect against calamity. Its application has expanded from sacred rites aligned with the traditional calendar to more flexible occasions, such as the beginning of the planting season or the inauguration of public facilities. While its forms have adapted over time, its core significance endures as a spiritual medium that reinforces solidarity and maintains balance between humans, nature, and supernatural forces.",

            "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Tengger in Old Javanese means “highlands” (Gericke and Roorda, 1901:918), and thus the meaning of Wong Tengger would have mean persons who lived in highlands. In nowadays Java, Tengger no longer refer to that, but cover to “perch and sit above” (Hefner, 1985:25). Wong Tengger ‘Tengger People’ are indigenous community who resides and surrounds around the slope of Mountain Brahma (Bromo). The Tengger highlands locates to the northeast from Malang. There are three gates to reach there: (1) the first route is going to the north from Malang to Pasuruan or Purwodadi, we will find the main entrance Wonokitri village in Tosari district and going up to the Ngadiwono village. These regions well known as western side (brang kulon) of Tengger highlands; (2) the second route is heading to Probolinggo, we will reach the main entrance is Cemoro Lawang village (Ngadisari district) and directly overlooks mount Bromo and Tengger caldera. These gates are popularly known as eastern side (brang wetan) of Tengger highlands; (3) the third access has two kinds of gates: (1) heading to Tumpang, Malang then we will reach the Gubugklakah, and the main gate is Ngadas village; (2) heading to Lumajang, and climbing to Senduro, Ranupani.

This formula consists of four words in Old Javenese: Oṅ or Om is often referred to mantra or formula praise; ṅhulun is the usual pronoun for the first person (Zoetmulder:1982). Whilst the rest of the words are still existed in modern Javanese, basuki means well-being, and laṅgĕṅ holds the meaning permanent. So, the Tenggerese salutation can be interpreted in the following: “Om, (Brahmā, Visnū, Sivā), I wish for eternal well-being”. Then, the receiver will reply: basuki laṅgĕṅ ‘well-being forever’. This salutation is given when someone visit their relatives by knocking the door or for maintaining social relationship among Tenggerese when they meet each other in market or climbing up to the Bromo.\n\nDukun Panḍita as divine actors \n\nIn order to maintain the divine relationship between the people of Tengger and their deities and ancestor, the role of dukun panḍita (priest of Tengger) is central (Sukmawan, 2022:14). In the rituals that they perform, the priest is acting like the middleman who mediate the realm world to divine world. By uttering their formulas (mantra) and mentioning the means of the ritual, the priest communicates to the unseen figures to the man who dedicated their offerings to their deities or ancestors. In all the rituals that are performed by Tenggerese, the priest is the main actor. Tenggerese often call the name of the dukun as Rama.

The ceremony is held at the village’s sacred site with a buffalo as the offering as a symbolic vehicle to the afterlife. Its purpose is to cleanse the village from disturbances of the spirits and to purify the souls to be sent to their original, perfect realm, namely Nirvana.

        "variant": "Dalam bahasa Jawa Timur sehari-hari, entas dan bentukannya seperti mentas mengalami perluasan makna yang bersifat kontekstual. Entas dipakai untuk ‘mengangkat’ atau ‘mengambil dari tempat semula’, sedangkan mentas lazim digunakan untuk aktivitas yang terkait air, misalnya “mentas saka kolam” (naik dari kolam) atau “mentas adus” (selesai mandi), dengan makna dasar ‘keluar dari’ atau ‘terlepas dari suatu keadaan’. Secara semantis, keduanya berpijak pada konsep ‘pembebasan’ atau ‘pemindahan’, sebagaimana tercermin dalam makna ritual entas-entas. Di Pacitan, entas-entas berarti mengumpulkan padi dari tiap rumah sebagai bagian pesta panen, sedangkan dalam tradisi Jawa istilah nyewu kerap diasosiasikan sebagai padanan ritual, meski berbeda dalam struktur dan simbolik. Variasi ini menunjukkan bahwa entas tidak hanya hidup dalam ranah spiritual, tetapi juga membumi dalam praktik keseharian masyarakat Jawa Timur.",
        "variantTranslations": "In East Javanese collocation, entas and its derivative forms, such as mentas, have undergone a contextual expansion of meaning. Entas generally refers to ‘lifting’ or ‘taking from its original place,’ while mentas is commonly used in water-related contexts, for example, “mentas saka kolam” (getting out of a pool) or “mentas adus” (finishing a bath), carrying the basic sense of ‘getting out of’ or ‘being released from’ a situation. Semantically, both terms are grounded in the concepts of ‘liberation’ or ‘transfer,’ as reflected in the entas-entas ritual. In Pacitan, entas-entas involves collecting rice from each household as part of a harvest festival, whereas in broader Javanese tradition, the term nyewu is often considered a ritual equivalent, though differing in structure and symbolism. This variation demonstrates that entas exists not only in the spiritual sphere but is also embedded in the everyday practices of East Javanese society.",

            "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Tengger in Old Javanese means “highlands” (Gericke and Roorda, 1901:918), and thus the meaning of Wong Tengger would have mean persons who lived in highlands. In nowadays Java, Tengger no longer refer to that, but cover to “perch and sit above” (Hefner, 1985:25). Wong Tengger ‘Tengger People’ are indigenous community who resides and surrounds around the slope of Mountain Brahma (Bromo). The Tengger highlands locates to the northeast from Malang. There are three gates to reach there: (1) the first route is going to the north from Malang to Pasuruan or Purwodadi, we will find the main entrance Wonokitri village in Tosari district and going up to the Ngadiwono village. These regions well known as western side (brang kulon) of Tengger highlands; (2) the second route is heading to Probolinggo, we will reach the main entrance is Cemoro Lawang village (Ngadisari district) and directly overlooks mount Bromo and Tengger caldera. These gates are popularly known as eastern side (brang wetan) of Tengger highlands; (3) the third access has two kinds of gates: (1) heading to Tumpang, Malang then we will reach the Gubugklakah, and the main gate is Ngadas village; (2) heading to Lumajang, and climbing to Senduro, Ranupani. These regions are known as southern (brang kidul) of Tengger highlands.\n\nHong hulun Basuki Langgeng\n\nHong Hulun Basuki Langgeng is Tenggerese salutation. This formula consists of four words in Old Javenese: Oṅ or Om is often referred to mantra or formula praise; ṅhulun is the usual pronoun for the first person (Zoetmulder:1982). Whilst the rest of the words are still existed in modern Javanese, basuki means well-being, and laṅgĕṅ holds the meaning permanent. So, the Tenggerese salutation can be interpreted in the following: “Om, (Brahmā, Visnū, Sivā), I wish for eternal well-being”. Then, the receiver will reply: basuki laṅgĕṅ ‘well-being forever’. This salutation is given when someone visit their relatives by knocking the door or for maintaining social relationship among Tenggerese when they meet each other in market or climbing up to the Bromo.\n\nDukun Panḍita as divine actors \n\nIn order to maintain the divine relationship between the people of Tengger and their deities and ancestor, the role of dukun panḍita (priest of Tengger) is central (Sukmawan, 2022:14). In the rituals that they perform, the priest is acting like the middleman who mediate the realm world to divine world. By uttering their formulas (mantra) and mentioning the means of the ritual, the priest communicates to the unseen figures to the man who dedicated their offerings to their deities or ancestors. In all the rituals that are performed by Tenggerese, the priest is the main actor. Tenggerese often call the name of the dukun as Rama. Every Tengger villages has dukun and the assistant of the dukun. dukun as Rama. Every Tengger villages has dukun and the assistant of the dukun.",

Upacara ini mencakup doa bersama, penyajian persembahan, permainan teka-teki (tjangkriman), dan pertunjukan tari seperti tajoeŋan atau sodorran. Menurut Hefner (1989: 114), sedekah Karo mencerminkan harmoni antara tradisi Hindu-Jawa kuno dan pengaruh Islam lokal dalam kehidupan spiritual Tengger. \"Karo merupakan nama bulan ke-2 dalam perhitungan tahun kalender Tengger. Dalam bulan ini orang Tengger mengadakan upacara atau selamatan dan perayaan untuk memuliakan, mengingat, dan memohon berkah kepada roh-roh halus dan arwah orang-orang yang telah meninggal dunia\" (Sukmawan, 2018:76)",
        "commonMeaning": "Karo adalah upacara adat tahunan masyarakat Tengger yang diselenggarakan sebagai ungkapan syukur kepada Sang Hyang Widi atas hasil pertanian, serta sebagai bentuk penghormatan kepada leluhur dan roh penjaga desa. Ritual ini ditandai dengan persembahan hasil bumi dan sesaji yang dibawa ke pura, gunung, atau tempat keramat lainnya, dan disertai pembacaan mantra, pentas seni, serta jamuan kolektif masyarakat. Upacara ini merekatkan solidaritas komunal, memperkuat identitas budaya, dan merefleksikan kosmologi keseimbangan antara manusia, alam, dan yang adikodrati.",
        "translation": "Karo is an annual customary ceremony of the Tengger community as an expression of gratitude to Sang Hyang Widi for agricultural harvests, as well as a form of reverence to the ancestors and the village guardian spirits. The ritual is marked by offerings of agricultural produce and ritual food placed at temples, mountains, or other sacred sites, along with the recitation of mantras, artistic performances, and communal feasts. This ceremony fosters communal solidarity, strengthens cultural identity, and reflects a cosmological balance among humans, nature, and the supernatural.",
        "variant": "Karo memiliki sejumlah varian penamaan maupun bentuk pelaksanaan yang mencerminkan keragaman praktik dan istilah dalam konteks lokal maupun regional. Upacara ini kadang disebut Hari Raya Karo, Upacara Karo, Sedekah Karo, atau Yadnya Karo, khususnya dalam narasi resmi atau administratif. Di wilayah Tengger luar inti seperti Tosari atau Ngadas, penyebutannya dapat bergeser menjadi Karoan sebagai bentuk tutur sehari-hari. Meski inti ritual tetap merujuk pada bulan Karo dalam kalender Tengger, terdapat pergeseran waktu pelaksanaan antardesa, disesuaikan dengan hasil musyawarah adat.",
        "variantTranslations": "Karo has a variety of naming and implementation practices, reflecting the diversity of local and regional contexts. This ceremony is sometimes referred to as Karo Holiday, Karo Ceremony, Karo Almsgiving, or Yadnya Karo, particularly in official or administrative contexts. In outer Tengger areas such as Tosari or Ngadas, the term often shifts to Karoan in everyday speech. While the core ritual remains linked to the Karo month in the Tengger calendar, the timing of the ceremony varies between villages, depending on the outcomes of customary deliberations.",

            "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Tengger in Old Javanese means “highlands” (Gericke and Roorda, 1901:918), and thus the meaning of Wong Tengger would have mean persons who lived in highlands. In nowadays Java, Tengger no longer refer to that, but cover to “perch and sit above” (Hefner, 1985:25). Wong Tengger ‘Tengger People’ are indigenous community who resides and surrounds around the slope of Mountain Brahma (Bromo). The Tengger highlands locates to the northeast from Malang. There are three gates to reach there: (1) the first route is going to the north from Malang to Pasuruan or Purwodadi, we will find the main entrance Wonokitri village in Tosari district and going up to the Ngadiwono village. These regions well known as western side (brang kulon) of Tengger highlands; (2) the second route is heading to Probolinggo, we will reach the main entrance is Cemoro Lawang village (Ngadisari district) and directly overlooks mount Bromo and Tengger caldera. These gates are popularly known as eastern side (brang wetan) of Tengger highlands; (3) the third access has two kinds of gates: (1) heading to Tumpang, Malang then we will reach the Gubugklakah, and the main gate is Ngadas village; (2) heading to Lumajang, and climbing to Senduro, Ranupani. These regions are known as southern (brang kidul) of Tengger highlands.\n\nHong hulun Basuki Langgeng\n\nHong Hulun Basuki Langgeng is Tenggerese salutation. This formula consists of four words in Old Javenese: Oṅ or Om is often referred to mantra or formula praise; ṅhulun is the usual pronoun for the first person (Zoetmulder:1982). Whilst the rest of the words are still existed in modern Javanese, basuki means well-being, and laṅgĕṅ holds the meaning permanent. So, the Tenggerese salutation can be interpreted in the following: “Om, (Brahmā, Visnū, Sivā), I wish for eternal well-being”. Then, the receiver will reply: basuki laṅgĕṅ ‘well-being forever’. This salutation is given when someone visit their relatives by knocking the door or for maintaining social relationship among Tenggerese when they meet each other in market or climbing up to the Bromo.\n\nDukun Panḍita as divine actors \n\nIn order to maintain the divine relationship between the people of Tengger and their deities and ancestor, the role of dukun panḍita (priest of Tengger) is central (Sukmawan, 2022:14). In the rituals that they perform, the priest is acting like the middleman who mediate the realm world to divine world. By uttering their formulas (mantra) and mentioning the means of the ritual, the priest communicates to the unseen figures to the man who dedicated their offerings to their deities or ancestors. In all the rituals that are performed by Tenggerese, the priest is the main actor. Tenggerese often call the name of the dukun as Rama. Every Tengger villages has dukun and the assistant of the dukun. dukun as Rama. Every Tengger villages has dukun and the assistant of the dukun.",

            "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Tengger in Old Javanese means “highlands” (Gericke and Roorda, 1901:918), and thus the meaning of Wong Tengger would have mean persons who lived in highlands. In nowadays Java, Tengger no longer refer to that, but cover to “perch and sit above” (Hefner, 1985:25). Wong Tengger ‘Tengger People’ are indigenous community who resides and surrounds around the slope of Mountain Brahma (Bromo). The Tengger highlands locates to the northeast from Malang. There are three gates to reach there: (1) the first route is going to the north from Malang to Pasuruan or Purwodadi, we will find the main entrance Wonokitri village in Tosari district and going up to the Ngadiwono village. These regions well known as western side (brang kulon) of Tengger highlands; (2) the second route is heading to Probolinggo, we will reach the main entrance is Cemoro Lawang village (Ngadisari district) and directly overlooks mount Bromo and Tengger caldera. These gates are popularly known as eastern side (brang wetan) of Tengger highlands; (3) the third access has two kinds of gates: (1) heading to Tumpang, Malang then we will reach the Gubugklakah, and the main gate is Ngadas village; (2) heading to Lumajang, and climbing to Senduro, Ranupani. These regions are known as southern (brang kidul) of Tengger highlands.\n\nHong hulun Basuki Langgeng\n\nHong Hulun Basuki Langgeng is Tenggerese salutation. This formula consists of four words in Old Javenese: Oṅ or Om is often referred to mantra or formula praise; ṅhulun is the usual pronoun for the first person (Zoetmulder:1982). Whilst the rest of the words are still existed in modern Javanese, basuki means well-being, and laṅgĕṅ holds the meaning permanent. So, the Tenggerese salutation can be interpreted in the following: “Om, (Brahmā, Visnū, Sivā), I wish for eternal well-being”. Then, the receiver will reply: basuki laṅgĕṅ ‘well-being forever’. This salutation is given when someone visit their relatives by knocking the door or for maintaining social relationship among Tenggerese when they meet each other in market or climbing up to the Bromo.\n\nDukun Panḍita as divine actors \n\nIn order to maintain the divine relationship between the people of Tengger and their deities and ancestor, the role of dukun panḍita (priest of Tengger) is central (Sukmawan, 2022:14). In the rituals that they perform, the priest is acting like the middleman who mediate the realm world to divine world. By uttering their formulas (mantra) and mentioning the means of the ritual, the priest communicates to the unseen figures to the man who dedicated their offerings to their deities or ancestors. In all the rituals that are performed by Tenggerese, the priest is the main actor. Tenggerese often call the name of the dukun as Rama. Every Tengger villages has dukun and the assistant of the dukun. dukun as Rama. Every Tengger villages has dukun and the assistant of the dukun.",

            "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Panaraga is an area that has been etched into the collective memory of Javanese history, with its ancient identity as the region of Wĕngkĕr. This is mentioned in the books Pararaton and Negara Kartagama (D.J Brandes, 1897). Etymologically, the name Wĕngkĕr derives from the phrase wĕngonan angker 'haunted place', which refers to the concept of a place filled with mystical and supernatural aura (Moelyadi, 1986). In the Serat Centhini, canto 213, as translated by Stein Callenfels, there is a narrative that strengthens the historical legacy of Panaraga, which asserts that Wĕngkĕr held an important position in the history of classical Javanese civilization and became the undeniable historical identity of Panaraga.\n\n Geographically, the Panaraga sub-ethnic group refers to the area in the western part of East Java Province, now known as Ponorogo Regency, stretching from the western side of Mount Wilis to eastern side of Mount Lawu. According to Junghuhn's records (1855), numerous altars and terraces resembling worship sites were discovered, which were considered by ancient Javanese society as the dwelling places of gods and sacred crowns. Valentijn (1862) provided a more detailed description that the Panaraga region stretched from Pacitan Bay on the southern coast to Sumbang Village with approximately 150 families, extending two miles east of Mount Lawu, bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south and Lodaya to the east, with the Semangi River in Sangkulang Village serving as an important geographical marker and Mount Wilis as a natural boundary between Panaraga, Nganjuk and Kediri.\n\n In sociocultural context, the Dutch Resident in Madiun, Lucien Adam (1938), provided interesting anthropological notes regarding the characteristics of the Panaraga sub-ethnic community: \n\n The mystery of the origin of the Panaraga people has not been clearly revealed. Although they do not live in isolation from the surrounding areas, their types and characters differ from surrounding districts. People from Panaraga are more independent and self-confident, but also tough, brave, reckless, quick-tempered, and prefer to travel compared to average people in central Java.\n\n Adam's observations reveal the unique temperament of the Panaraga ethnic group, which differs from the general Javanese ethnic group, possessing an independent, brave, and highly adventurous spirit, represented by the figure of Warok as their sociocultural identity. Terminologically, Warok comes from the word waro'i or wirangi, which means 'already understands both physically and spiritually, whose actions are solely to help others', or from the word wewarah (Arabic: wara') which means 'to distance oneself from doubtful things', thus Warok can be interpreted as individual with supernatural power who uses their abilities for social good and holds a high status in Panaraga society. \n\n The existence of Warok cannot be separated from the art of reyog—both are like two sides of a coin united in the ethnic identity of Panaraga. The word reyog itself has various debated interpretations, ranging from the onomatopoeic hypothesis of the riyeg-riyeg bamboo sound to Mbah Wo Kucing's philosophical interpretation, which states REYOG as an acronym for five spiritual elements (R: rasa kidung (feeling of song), E: engwang sukma adiluhung (noble soul's essence), Y: Yang Widhi (The Divine), O: olah kridhaning Gusti (the Lord's creative act), G: gelar gumulung kĕrsaning Kang Maha Kuasa (the unfolding of the Almighty's will)), which means that reyog is not merely a performing art but a spiritual medium that connects humans with the divine dimension through artistic expression rich in the philosophical values of the Ponorogo community.\n\nRegardless of various etymological interpretations, the art of reyog was born from a complex socio-political context as a form of criticism by Warok Ki Ageng Kutu Suryaalam against the Majapahit government under the rule of King Brawijaya V, which was considered overly dominated by the queen consort. The phenomenon is symbolized in the form of singa barong or dadak merak—a tiger's head with a peacock's neck—which represents a subtle satire of a leadership that has lost its direction and power. \n\nPanaraga, with its historical and cultural identity, offers a unique depiction of cultural complexity within the mosaic of Javanese culture, featuring Warok as a central figure and reyog as an artistic expression rich in cultural and philosophical meaning. Therefore, this cultural heritage not only becomes a historical asset but also a living identity that must be continuously preserved by future generations as the proud ethnic identity of Panaraga.",

            "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Tengger in Old Javanese means “highlands” (Gericke and Roorda, 1901:918), and thus the meaning of Wong Tengger would have mean persons who lived in highlands. In nowadays Java, Tengger no longer refer to that, but cover to “perch and sit above” (Hefner, 1985:25). Wong Tengger ‘Tengger People’ are indigenous community who resides and surrounds around the slope of Mountain Brahma (Bromo). The Tengger highlands locates to the northeast from Malang. There are three gates to reach there: (1) the first route is going to the north from Malang to Pasuruan or Purwodadi, we will find the main entrance Wonokitri village in Tosari district and going up to the Ngadiwono village. These regions well known as western side (brang kulon) of Tengger highlands; (2) the second route is heading to Probolinggo, we will reach the main entrance is Cemoro Lawang village (Ngadisari district) and directly overlooks mount Bromo and Tengger caldera. These gates are popularly known as eastern side (brang wetan) of Tengger highlands; (3) the third access has two kinds of gates: (1) heading to Tumpang, Malang then we will reach the Gubugklakah, and the main gate is Ngadas village; (2) heading to Lumajang, and climbing to Senduro, Ranupani. These regions are known as southern (brang kidul) of Tengger highlands.\n\nHong hulun Basuki Langgeng\n\nHong Hulun Basuki Langgeng is Tenggerese salutation. This formula consists of four words in Old Javenese: Oṅ or Om is often referred to mantra or formula praise; ṅhulun is the usual pronoun for the first person (Zoetmulder:1982). Whilst the rest of the words are still existed in modern Javanese, basuki means well-being, and laṅgĕṅ holds the meaning permanent. So, the Tenggerese salutation can be interpreted in the following: “Om, (Brahmā, Visnū, Sivā), I wish for eternal well-being”. Then, the receiver will reply: basuki laṅgĕṅ ‘well-being forever’. This salutation is given when someone visit their relatives by knocking the door or for maintaining social relationship among Tenggerese when they meet each other in market or climbing up to the Bromo.\n\nDukun Panḍita as divine actors \n\nIn order to maintain the divine relationship between the people of Tengger and their deities and ancestor, the role of dukun panḍita (priest of Tengger) is central (Sukmawan, 2022:14). In the rituals that they perform, the priest is acting like the middleman who mediate the realm world to divine world. By uttering their formulas (mantra) and mentioning the means of the ritual, the priest communicates to the unseen figures to the man who dedicated their offerings to their deities or ancestors. In all the rituals that are performed by Tenggerese, the priest is the main actor. Tenggerese often call the name of the dukun as Rama. Every Tengger villages has dukun and the assistant of the dukun. dukun as Rama. Every Tengger villages has dukun and the assistant of the dukun.",

            "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Tengger in Old Javanese means “highlands” (Gericke and Roorda, 1901:918), and thus the meaning of Wong Tengger would have mean persons who lived in highlands. In nowadays Java, Tengger no longer refer to that, but cover to “perch and sit above” (Hefner, 1985:25). Wong Tengger ‘Tengger People’ are indigenous community who resides and surrounds around the slope of Mountain Brahma (Bromo). The Tengger highlands locates to the northeast from Malang. There are three gates to reach there: (1) the first route is going to the north from Malang to Pasuruan or Purwodadi, we will find the main entrance Wonokitri village in Tosari district and going up to the Ngadiwono village. These regions well known as western side (brang kulon) of Tengger highlands; (2) the second route is heading to Probolinggo, we will reach the main entrance is Cemoro Lawang village (Ngadisari district) and directly overlooks mount Bromo and Tengger caldera. These gates are popularly known as eastern side (brang wetan) of Tengger highlands; (3) the third access has two kinds of gates: (1) heading to Tumpang, Malang then we will reach the Gubugklakah, and the main gate is Ngadas village; (2) heading to Lumajang, and climbing to Senduro, Ranupani. These regions are known as southern (brang kidul) of Tengger highlands.\n\nHong hulun Basuki Langgeng\n\nHong Hulun Basuki Langgeng is Tenggerese salutation. This formula consists of four words in Old Javenese: Oṅ or Om is often referred to mantra or formula praise; ṅhulun is the usual pronoun for the first person (Zoetmulder:1982). Whilst the rest of the words are still existed in modern Javanese, basuki means well-being, and laṅgĕṅ holds the meaning permanent. So, the Tenggerese salutation can be interpreted in the following: “Om, (Brahmā, Visnū, Sivā), I wish for eternal well-being”. Then, the receiver will reply: basuki laṅgĕṅ ‘well-being forever’. This salutation is given when someone visit their relatives by knocking the door or for maintaining social relationship among Tenggerese when they meet each other in market or climbing up to the Bromo.\n\nDukun Panḍita as divine actors \n\nIn order to maintain the divine relationship between the people of Tengger and their deities and ancestor, the role of dukun panḍita (priest of Tengger) is central (Sukmawan, 2022:14). In the rituals that they perform, the priest is acting like the middleman who mediate the realm world to divine world. By uttering their formulas (mantra) and mentioning the means of the ritual, the priest communicates to the unseen figures to the man who dedicated their offerings to their deities or ancestors. In all the rituals that are performed by Tenggerese, the priest is the main actor. Tenggerese often call the name of the dukun as Rama. Every Tengger villages has dukun and the assistant of the dukun. dukun as Rama. Every Tengger villages has dukun and the assistant of the dukun.",

In nowadays Java, Tengger no longer refer to that, but cover to “perch and sit above” (Hefner, 1985:25). Wong Tengger ‘Tengger People’ are indigenous community who resides and surrounds around the slope of Mountain Brahma (Bromo). The Tengger highlands locates to the northeast from Malang. There are three gates to reach there: (1) the first route is going to the north from Malang to Pasuruan or Purwodadi, we will find the main entrance Wonokitri village in Tosari district and going up to the Ngadiwono village. These regions well known as western side (brang kulon) of Tengger highlands; (2) the second route is heading to Probolinggo, we will reach the main entrance is Cemoro Lawang village (Ngadisari district) and directly overlooks mount Bromo and Tengger caldera. These gates are popularly known as eastern side (brang wetan) of Tengger highlands; (3) the third access has two kinds of gates: (1) heading to Tumpang, Malang then we will reach the Gubugklakah, and the main gate is Ngadas village; (2) heading to Lumajang, and climbing to Senduro, Ranupani. These regions are known as southern (brang kidul) of Tengger highlands.\n\nHong hulun Basuki Langgeng\n\nHong Hulun Basuki Langgeng is Tenggerese salutation. This formula consists of four words in Old Javenese: Oṅ or Om is often referred to mantra or formula praise; ṅhulun is the usual pronoun for the first person (Zoetmulder:1982). Whilst the rest of the words are still existed in modern Javanese, basuki means well-being, and laṅgĕṅ holds the meaning permanent. So, the Tenggerese salutation can be interpreted in the following: “Om, (Brahmā, Visnū, Sivā), I wish for eternal well-being”. Then, the receiver will reply: basuki laṅgĕṅ ‘well-being forever’. This salutation is given when someone visit their relatives by knocking the door or for maintaining social relationship among Tenggerese when they meet each other in market or climbing up to the Bromo.\n\nDukun Panḍita as divine actors \n\nIn order to maintain the divine relationship between the people of Tengger and their deities and ancestor, the role of dukun panḍita (priest of Tengger) is central (Sukmawan, 2022:14). In the rituals that they perform, the priest is acting like the middleman who mediate the realm world to divine world. By uttering their formulas (mantra) and mentioning the means of the ritual, the priest communicates to the unseen figures to the man who dedicated their offerings to their deities or ancestors. In all the rituals that are performed by Tenggerese, the priest is the main actor. Tenggerese often call the name of the dukun as Rama. Every Tengger villages has dukun and the assistant of the dukun. dukun as Rama. Every Tengger villages has dukun and the assistant of the dukun.",

            "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Tengger in Old Javanese means “highlands” (Gericke and Roorda, 1901:918), and thus the meaning of Wong Tengger would have mean persons who lived in highlands. In nowadays Java, Tengger no longer refer to that, but cover to “perch and sit above” (Hefner, 1985:25). Wong Tengger ‘Tengger People’ are indigenous community who resides and surrounds around the slope of Mountain Brahma (Bromo). The Tengger highlands locates to the northeast from Malang. There are three gates to reach there: (1) the first route is going to the north from Malang to Pasuruan or Purwodadi, we will find the main entrance Wonokitri village in Tosari district and going up to the Ngadiwono village. These regions well known as western side (brang kulon) of Tengger highlands; (2) the second route is heading to Probolinggo, we will reach the main entrance is Cemoro Lawang village (Ngadisari district) and directly overlooks mount Bromo and Tengger caldera. These gates are popularly known as eastern side (brang wetan) of Tengger highlands; (3) the third access has two kinds of gates: (1) heading to Tumpang, Malang then we will reach the Gubugklakah, and the main gate is Ngadas village; (2) heading to Lumajang, and climbing to Senduro, Ranupani. These regions are known as southern (brang kidul) of Tengger highlands.\n\nHong hulun Basuki Langgeng\n\nHong Hulun Basuki Langgeng is Tenggerese salutation. This formula consists of four words in Old Javenese: Oṅ or Om is often referred to mantra or formula praise; ṅhulun is the usual pronoun for the first person (Zoetmulder:1982). Whilst the rest of the words are still existed in modern Javanese, basuki means well-being, and laṅgĕṅ holds the meaning permanent. So, the Tenggerese salutation can be interpreted in the following: “Om, (Brahmā, Visnū, Sivā), I wish for eternal well-being”. Then, the receiver will reply: basuki laṅgĕṅ ‘well-being forever’. This salutation is given when someone visit their relatives by knocking the door or for maintaining social relationship among Tenggerese when they meet each other in market or climbing up to the Bromo.\n\nDukun Panḍita as divine actors \n\nIn order to maintain the divine relationship between the people of Tengger and their deities and ancestor, the role of dukun panḍita (priest of Tengger) is central (Sukmawan, 2022:14). In the rituals that they perform, the priest is acting like the middleman who mediate the realm world to divine world. By uttering their formulas (mantra) and mentioning the means of the ritual, the priest communicates to the unseen figures to the man who dedicated their offerings to their deities or ancestors. In all the rituals that are performed by Tenggerese, the priest is the main actor. Tenggerese often call the name of the dukun as Rama. Every Tengger villages has dukun and the assistant of the dukun. dukun as Rama. Every Tengger villages has dukun and the assistant of the dukun.",

In nowadays Java, Tengger no longer refer to that, but cover to “perch and sit above” (Hefner, 1985:25). Wong Tengger ‘Tengger People’ are indigenous community who resides and surrounds around the slope of Mountain Brahma (Bromo). The Tengger highlands locates to the northeast from Malang. There are three gates to reach there: (1) the first route is going to the north from Malang to Pasuruan or Purwodadi, we will find the main entrance Wonokitri village in Tosari district and going up to the Ngadiwono village. These regions well known as western side (brang kulon) of Tengger highlands; (2) the second route is heading to Probolinggo, we will reach the main entrance is Cemoro Lawang village (Ngadisari district) and directly overlooks mount Bromo and Tengger caldera. These gates are popularly known as eastern side (brang wetan) of Tengger highlands; (3) the third access has two kinds of gates: (1) heading to Tumpang, Malang then we will reach the Gubugklakah, and the main gate is Ngadas village; (2) heading to Lumajang, and climbing to Senduro, Ranupani.

Whilst the rest of the words are still existed in modern Javanese, basuki means well-being, and laṅgĕṅ holds the meaning permanent. So, the Tenggerese salutation can be interpreted in the following: “Om, (Brahmā, Visnū, Sivā), I wish for eternal well-being”. Then, the receiver will reply: basuki laṅgĕṅ ‘well-being forever’. This salutation is given when someone visit their relatives by knocking the door or for maintaining social relationship among Tenggerese when they meet each other in market or climbing up to the Bromo.\n\nDukun Panḍita as divine actors \n\nIn order to maintain the divine relationship between the people of Tengger and their deities and ancestor, the role of dukun panḍita (priest of Tengger) is central (Sukmawan, 2022:14). In the rituals that they perform, the priest is acting like the middleman who mediate the realm world to divine world. By uttering their formulas (mantra) and mentioning the means of the ritual, the priest communicates to the unseen figures to the man who dedicated their offerings to their deities or ancestors. In all the rituals that are performed by Tenggerese, the priest is the main actor. Tenggerese often call the name of the dukun as Rama.

Wong Tengger ‘Tengger People’ are indigenous community who resides and surrounds around the slope of Mountain Brahma (Bromo). The Tengger highlands locates to the northeast from Malang. There are three gates to reach there: (1) the first route is going to the north from Malang to Pasuruan or Purwodadi, we will find the main entrance Wonokitri village in Tosari district and going up to the Ngadiwono village. These regions well known as western side (brang kulon) of Tengger highlands; (2) the second route is heading to Probolinggo, we will reach the main entrance is Cemoro Lawang village (Ngadisari district) and directly overlooks mount Bromo and Tengger caldera. These gates are popularly known as eastern side (brang wetan) of Tengger highlands; (3) the third access has two kinds of gates: (1) heading to Tumpang, Malang then we will reach the Gubugklakah, and the main gate is Ngadas village; (2) heading to Lumajang, and climbing to Senduro, Ranupani. These regions are known as southern (brang kidul) of Tengger highlands.\n\nHong hulun Basuki Langgeng\n\nHong Hulun Basuki Langgeng is Tenggerese salutation. This formula consists of four words in Old Javenese: Oṅ or Om is often referred to mantra or formula praise; ṅhulun is the usual pronoun for the first person (Zoetmulder:1982). Whilst the rest of the words are still existed in modern Javanese, basuki means well-being, and laṅgĕṅ holds the meaning permanent. So, the Tenggerese salutation can be interpreted in the following: “Om, (Brahmā, Visnū, Sivā), I wish for eternal well-being”. Then, the receiver will reply: basuki laṅgĕṅ ‘well-being forever’. This salutation is given when someone visit their relatives by knocking the door or for maintaining social relationship among Tenggerese when they meet each other in market or climbing up to the Bromo.\n\nDukun Panḍita as divine actors \n\nIn order to maintain the divine relationship between the people of Tengger and their deities and ancestor, the role of dukun panḍita (priest of Tengger) is central (Sukmawan, 2022:14). In the rituals that they perform, the priest is acting like the middleman who mediate the realm world to divine world. By uttering their formulas (mantra) and mentioning the means of the ritual, the priest communicates to the unseen figures to the man who dedicated their offerings to their deities or ancestors. In all the rituals that are performed by Tenggerese, the priest is the main actor. Tenggerese often call the name of the dukun as Rama. Every Tengger villages has dukun and the assistant of the dukun. dukun as Rama. Every Tengger villages has dukun and the assistant of the dukun.",

            "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Panaraga is an area that has been etched into the collective memory of Javanese history, with its ancient identity as the region of Wĕngkĕr. This is mentioned in the books Pararaton and Negara Kartagama (D.J Brandes, 1897). Etymologically, the name Wĕngkĕr derives from the phrase wĕngonan angker 'haunted place', which refers to the concept of a place filled with mystical and supernatural aura (Moelyadi, 1986). In the Serat Centhini, canto 213, as translated by Stein Callenfels, there is a narrative that strengthens the historical legacy of Panaraga, which asserts that Wĕngkĕr held an important position in the history of classical Javanese civilization and became the undeniable historical identity of Panaraga.\n\n Geographically, the Panaraga sub-ethnic group refers to the area in the western part of East Java Province, now known as Ponorogo Regency, stretching from the western side of Mount Wilis to eastern side of Mount Lawu. According to Junghuhn's records (1855), numerous altars and terraces resembling worship sites were discovered, which were considered by ancient Javanese society as the dwelling places of gods and sacred crowns. Valentijn (1862) provided a more detailed description that the Panaraga region stretched from Pacitan Bay on the southern coast to Sumbang Village with approximately 150 families, extending two miles east of Mount Lawu, bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south and Lodaya to the east, with the Semangi River in Sangkulang Village serving as an important geographical marker and Mount Wilis as a natural boundary between Panaraga, Nganjuk and Kediri.\n\n In sociocultural context, the Dutch Resident in Madiun, Lucien Adam (1938), provided interesting anthropological notes regarding the characteristics of the Panaraga sub-ethnic community: \n\n The mystery of the origin of the Panaraga people has not been clearly revealed. Although they do not live in isolation from the surrounding areas, their types and characters differ from surrounding districts. People from Panaraga are more independent and self-confident, but also tough, brave, reckless, quick-tempered, and prefer to travel compared to average people in central Java.\n\n Adam's observations reveal the unique temperament of the Panaraga ethnic group, which differs from the general Javanese ethnic group, possessing an independent, brave, and highly adventurous spirit, represented by the figure of Warok as their sociocultural identity. Terminologically, Warok comes from the word waro'i or wirangi, which means 'already understands both physically and spiritually, whose actions are solely to help others', or from the word wewarah (Arabic: wara') which means 'to distance oneself from doubtful things', thus Warok can be interpreted as individual with supernatural power who uses their abilities for social good and holds a high status in Panaraga society. \n\n The existence of Warok cannot be separated from the art of reyog—both are like two sides of a coin united in the ethnic identity of Panaraga. The word reyog itself has various debated interpretations, ranging from the onomatopoeic hypothesis of the riyeg-riyeg bamboo sound to Mbah Wo Kucing's philosophical interpretation, which states REYOG as an acronym for five spiritual elements (R: rasa kidung (feeling of song), E: engwang sukma adiluhung (noble soul's essence), Y: Yang Widhi (The Divine), O: olah kridhaning Gusti (the Lord's creative act), G: gelar gumulung kĕrsaning Kang Maha Kuasa (the unfolding of the Almighty's will)), which means that reyog is not merely a performing art but a spiritual medium that connects humans with the divine dimension through artistic expression rich in the philosophical values of the Ponorogo community.\n\nRegardless of various etymological interpretations, the art of reyog was born from a complex socio-political context as a form of criticism by Warok Ki Ageng Kutu Suryaalam against the Majapahit government under the rule of King Brawijaya V, which was considered overly dominated by the queen consort. The phenomenon is symbolized in the form of singa barong or dadak merak—a tiger's head with a peacock's neck—which represents a subtle satire of a leadership that has lost its direction and power. \n\nPanaraga, with its historical and cultural identity, offers a unique depiction of cultural complexity within the mosaic of Javanese culture, featuring Warok as a central figure and reyog as an artistic expression rich in cultural and philosophical meaning. Therefore, this cultural heritage not only becomes a historical asset but also a living identity that must be continuously preserved by future generations as the proud ethnic identity of Panaraga.",

            "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Tengger in Old Javanese means “highlands” (Gericke and Roorda, 1901:918), and thus the meaning of Wong Tengger would have mean persons who lived in highlands. In nowadays Java, Tengger no longer refer to that, but cover to “perch and sit above” (Hefner, 1985:25). Wong Tengger ‘Tengger People’ are indigenous community who resides and surrounds around the slope of Mountain Brahma (Bromo). The Tengger highlands locates to the northeast from Malang. There are three gates to reach there: (1) the first route is going to the north from Malang to Pasuruan or Purwodadi, we will find the main entrance Wonokitri village in Tosari district and going up to the Ngadiwono village. These regions well known as western side (brang kulon) of Tengger highlands; (2) the second route is heading to Probolinggo, we will reach the main entrance is Cemoro Lawang village (Ngadisari district) and directly overlooks mount Bromo and Tengger caldera. These gates are popularly known as eastern side (brang wetan) of Tengger highlands; (3) the third access has two kinds of gates: (1) heading to Tumpang, Malang then we will reach the Gubugklakah, and the main gate is Ngadas village; (2) heading to Lumajang, and climbing to Senduro, Ranupani. These regions are known as southern (brang kidul) of Tengger highlands.\n\nHong hulun Basuki Langgeng\n\nHong Hulun Basuki Langgeng is Tenggerese salutation. This formula consists of four words in Old Javenese: Oṅ or Om is often referred to mantra or formula praise; ṅhulun is the usual pronoun for the first person (Zoetmulder:1982). Whilst the rest of the words are still existed in modern Javanese, basuki means well-being, and laṅgĕṅ holds the meaning permanent. So, the Tenggerese salutation can be interpreted in the following: “Om, (Brahmā, Visnū, Sivā), I wish for eternal well-being”. Then, the receiver will reply: basuki laṅgĕṅ ‘well-being forever’. This salutation is given when someone visit their relatives by knocking the door or for maintaining social relationship among Tenggerese when they meet each other in market or climbing up to the Bromo.\n\nDukun Panḍita as divine actors \n\nIn order to maintain the divine relationship between the people of Tengger and their deities and ancestor, the role of dukun panḍita (priest of Tengger) is central (Sukmawan, 2022:14). In the rituals that they perform, the priest is acting like the middleman who mediate the realm world to divine world. By uttering their formulas (mantra) and mentioning the means of the ritual, the priest communicates to the unseen figures to the man who dedicated their offerings to their deities or ancestors. In all the rituals that are performed by Tenggerese, the priest is the main actor. Tenggerese often call the name of the dukun as Rama. Every Tengger villages has dukun and the assistant of the dukun. dukun as Rama. Every Tengger villages has dukun and the assistant of the dukun.",

            "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Panaraga is an area that has been etched into the collective memory of Javanese history, with its ancient identity as the region of Wĕngkĕr. This is mentioned in the books Pararaton and Negara Kartagama (D.J Brandes, 1897). Etymologically, the name Wĕngkĕr derives from the phrase wĕngonan angker 'haunted place', which refers to the concept of a place filled with mystical and supernatural aura (Moelyadi, 1986). In the Serat Centhini, canto 213, as translated by Stein Callenfels, there is a narrative that strengthens the historical legacy of Panaraga, which asserts that Wĕngkĕr held an important position in the history of classical Javanese civilization and became the undeniable historical identity of Panaraga.\n\n Geographically, the Panaraga sub-ethnic group refers to the area in the western part of East Java Province, now known as Ponorogo Regency, stretching from the western side of Mount Wilis to eastern side of Mount Lawu. According to Junghuhn's records (1855), numerous altars and terraces resembling worship sites were discovered, which were considered by ancient Javanese society as the dwelling places of gods and sacred crowns. Valentijn (1862) provided a more detailed description that the Panaraga region stretched from Pacitan Bay on the southern coast to Sumbang Village with approximately 150 families, extending two miles east of Mount Lawu, bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south and Lodaya to the east, with the Semangi River in Sangkulang Village serving as an important geographical marker and Mount Wilis as a natural boundary between Panaraga, Nganjuk and Kediri.\n\n In sociocultural context, the Dutch Resident in Madiun, Lucien Adam (1938), provided interesting anthropological notes regarding the characteristics of the Panaraga sub-ethnic community: \n\n The mystery of the origin of the Panaraga people has not been clearly revealed. Although they do not live in isolation from the surrounding areas, their types and characters differ from surrounding districts. People from Panaraga are more independent and self-confident, but also tough, brave, reckless, quick-tempered, and prefer to travel compared to average people in central Java.\n\n Adam's observations reveal the unique temperament of the Panaraga ethnic group, which differs from the general Javanese ethnic group, possessing an independent, brave, and highly adventurous spirit, represented by the figure of Warok as their sociocultural identity. Terminologically, Warok comes from the word waro'i or wirangi, which means 'already understands both physically and spiritually, whose actions are solely to help others', or from the word wewarah (Arabic: wara') which means 'to distance oneself from doubtful things', thus Warok can be interpreted as individual with supernatural power who uses their abilities for social good and holds a high status in Panaraga society. \n\n The existence of Warok cannot be separated from the art of reyog—both are like two sides of a coin united in the ethnic identity of Panaraga. The word reyog itself has various debated interpretations, ranging from the onomatopoeic hypothesis of the riyeg-riyeg bamboo sound to Mbah Wo Kucing's philosophical interpretation, which states REYOG as an acronym for five spiritual elements (R: rasa kidung (feeling of song), E: engwang sukma adiluhung (noble soul's essence), Y: Yang Widhi (The Divine), O: olah kridhaning Gusti (the Lord's creative act), G: gelar gumulung kĕrsaning Kang Maha Kuasa (the unfolding of the Almighty's will)), which means that reyog is not merely a performing art but a spiritual medium that connects humans with the divine dimension through artistic expression rich in the philosophical values of the Ponorogo community.\n\nRegardless of various etymological interpretations, the art of reyog was born from a complex socio-political context as a form of criticism by Warok Ki Ageng Kutu Suryaalam against the Majapahit government under the rule of King Brawijaya V, which was considered overly dominated by the queen consort. The phenomenon is symbolized in the form of singa barong or dadak merak—a tiger's head with a peacock's neck—which represents a subtle satire of a leadership that has lost its direction and power. \n\nPanaraga, with its historical and cultural identity, offers a unique depiction of cultural complexity within the mosaic of Javanese culture, featuring Warok as a central figure and reyog as an artistic expression rich in cultural and philosophical meaning. Therefore, this cultural heritage not only becomes a historical asset but also a living identity that must be continuously preserved by future generations as the proud ethnic identity of Panaraga.",

The word reyog itself has various debated interpretations, ranging from the onomatopoeic hypothesis of the riyeg-riyeg bamboo sound to Mbah Wo Kucing's philosophical interpretation, which states REYOG as an acronym for five spiritual elements (R: rasa kidung (feeling of song), E: engwang sukma adiluhung (noble soul's essence), Y: Yang Widhi (The Divine), O: olah kridhaning Gusti (the Lord's creative act), G: gelar gumulung kĕrsaning Kang Maha Kuasa (the unfolding of the Almighty's will)), which means that reyog is not merely a performing art but a spiritual medium that connects humans with the divine dimension through artistic expression rich in the philosophical values of the Ponorogo community.\n\nRegardless of various etymological interpretations, the art of reyog was born from a complex socio-political context as a form of criticism by Warok Ki Ageng Kutu Suryaalam against the Majapahit government under the rule of King Brawijaya V, which was considered overly dominated by the queen consort. The phenomenon is symbolized in the form of singa barong or dadak merak—a tiger's head with a peacock's neck—which represents a subtle satire of a leadership that has lost its direction and power. \n\nPanaraga, with its historical and cultural identity, offers a unique depiction of cultural complexity within the mosaic of Javanese culture, featuring Warok as a central figure and reyog as an artistic expression rich in cultural and philosophical meaning. Therefore, this cultural heritage not only becomes a historical asset but also a living identity that must be continuously preserved by future generations as the proud ethnic identity of Panaraga.",

            "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Panaraga is an area that has been etched into the collective memory of Javanese history, with its ancient identity as the region of Wĕngkĕr. This is mentioned in the books Pararaton and Negara Kartagama (D.J Brandes, 1897). Etymologically, the name Wĕngkĕr derives from the phrase wĕngonan angker 'haunted place', which refers to the concept of a place filled with mystical and supernatural aura (Moelyadi, 1986). In the Serat Centhini, canto 213, as translated by Stein Callenfels, there is a narrative that strengthens the historical legacy of Panaraga, which asserts that Wĕngkĕr held an important position in the history of classical Javanese civilization and became the undeniable historical identity of Panaraga.\n\n Geographically, the Panaraga sub-ethnic group refers to the area in the western part of East Java Province, now known as Ponorogo Regency, stretching from the western side of Mount Wilis to eastern side of Mount Lawu. According to Junghuhn's records (1855), numerous altars and terraces resembling worship sites were discovered, which were considered by ancient Javanese society as the dwelling places of gods and sacred crowns. Valentijn (1862) provided a more detailed description that the Panaraga region stretched from Pacitan Bay on the southern coast to Sumbang Village with approximately 150 families, extending two miles east of Mount Lawu, bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south and Lodaya to the east, with the Semangi River in Sangkulang Village serving as an important geographical marker and Mount Wilis as a natural boundary between Panaraga, Nganjuk and Kediri.\n\n In sociocultural context, the Dutch Resident in Madiun, Lucien Adam (1938), provided interesting anthropological notes regarding the characteristics of the Panaraga sub-ethnic community: \n\n The mystery of the origin of the Panaraga people has not been clearly revealed. Although they do not live in isolation from the surrounding areas, their types and characters differ from surrounding districts. People from Panaraga are more independent and self-confident, but also tough, brave, reckless, quick-tempered, and prefer to travel compared to average people in central Java.\n\n Adam's observations reveal the unique temperament of the Panaraga ethnic group, which differs from the general Javanese ethnic group, possessing an independent, brave, and highly adventurous spirit, represented by the figure of Warok as their sociocultural identity.

The word reyog itself has various debated interpretations, ranging from the onomatopoeic hypothesis of the riyeg-riyeg bamboo sound to Mbah Wo Kucing's philosophical interpretation, which states REYOG as an acronym for five spiritual elements (R: rasa kidung (feeling of song), E: engwang sukma adiluhung (noble soul's essence), Y: Yang Widhi (The Divine), O: olah kridhaning Gusti (the Lord's creative act), G: gelar gumulung kĕrsaning Kang Maha Kuasa (the unfolding of the Almighty's will)), which means that reyog is not merely a performing art but a spiritual medium that connects humans with the divine dimension through artistic expression rich in the philosophical values of the Ponorogo community.\n\nRegardless of various etymological interpretations, the art of reyog was born from a complex socio-political context as a form of criticism by Warok Ki Ageng Kutu Suryaalam against the Majapahit government under the rule of King Brawijaya V, which was considered overly dominated by the queen consort.

            "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Panaraga is an area that has been etched into the collective memory of Javanese history, with its ancient identity as the region of Wĕngkĕr. This is mentioned in the books Pararaton and Negara Kartagama (D.J Brandes, 1897). Etymologically, the name Wĕngkĕr derives from the phrase wĕngonan angker 'haunted place', which refers to the concept of a place filled with mystical and supernatural aura (Moelyadi, 1986). In the Serat Centhini, canto 213, as translated by Stein Callenfels, there is a narrative that strengthens the historical legacy of Panaraga, which asserts that Wĕngkĕr held an important position in the history of classical Javanese civilization and became the undeniable historical identity of Panaraga.\n\n Geographically, the Panaraga sub-ethnic group refers to the area in the western part of East Java Province, now known as Ponorogo Regency, stretching from the western side of Mount Wilis to eastern side of Mount Lawu. According to Junghuhn's records (1855), numerous altars and terraces resembling worship sites were discovered, which were considered by ancient Javanese society as the dwelling places of gods and sacred crowns. Valentijn (1862) provided a more detailed description that the Panaraga region stretched from Pacitan Bay on the southern coast to Sumbang Village with approximately 150 families, extending two miles east of Mount Lawu, bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south and Lodaya to the east, with the Semangi River in Sangkulang Village serving as an important geographical marker and Mount Wilis as a natural boundary between Panaraga, Nganjuk and Kediri.\n\n In sociocultural context, the Dutch Resident in Madiun, Lucien Adam (1938), provided interesting anthropological notes regarding the characteristics of the Panaraga sub-ethnic community: \n\n The mystery of the origin of the Panaraga people has not been clearly revealed. Although they do not live in isolation from the surrounding areas, their types and characters differ from surrounding districts. People from Panaraga are more independent and self-confident, but also tough, brave, reckless, quick-tempered, and prefer to travel compared to average people in central Java.\n\n Adam's observations reveal the unique temperament of the Panaraga ethnic group, which differs from the general Javanese ethnic group, possessing an independent, brave, and highly adventurous spirit, represented by the figure of Warok as their sociocultural identity. Terminologically, Warok comes from the word waro'i or wirangi, which means 'already understands both physically and spiritually, whose actions are solely to help others', or from the word wewarah (Arabic: wara') which means 'to distance oneself from doubtful things', thus Warok can be interpreted as individual with supernatural power who uses their abilities for social good and holds a high status in Panaraga society. \n\n The existence of Warok cannot be separated from the art of reyog—both are like two sides of a coin united in the ethnic identity of Panaraga. The word reyog itself has various debated interpretations, ranging from the onomatopoeic hypothesis of the riyeg-riyeg bamboo sound to Mbah Wo Kucing's philosophical interpretation, which states REYOG as an acronym for five spiritual elements (R: rasa kidung (feeling of song), E: engwang sukma adiluhung (noble soul's essence), Y: Yang Widhi (The Divine), O: olah kridhaning Gusti (the Lord's creative act), G: gelar gumulung kĕrsaning Kang Maha Kuasa (the unfolding of the Almighty's will)), which means that reyog is not merely a performing art but a spiritual medium that connects humans with the divine dimension through artistic expression rich in the philosophical values of the Ponorogo community.\n\nRegardless of various etymological interpretations, the art of reyog was born from a complex socio-political context as a form of criticism by Warok Ki Ageng Kutu Suryaalam against the Majapahit government under the rule of King Brawijaya V, which was considered overly dominated by the queen consort. The phenomenon is symbolized in the form of singa barong or dadak merak—a tiger's head with a peacock's neck—which represents a subtle satire of a leadership that has lost its direction and power. \n\nPanaraga, with its historical and cultural identity, offers a unique depiction of cultural complexity within the mosaic of Javanese culture, featuring Warok as a central figure and reyog as an artistic expression rich in cultural and philosophical meaning. Therefore, this cultural heritage not only becomes a historical asset but also a living identity that must be continuously preserved by future generations as the proud ethnic identity of Panaraga.",

            "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Panaraga is an area that has been etched into the collective memory of Javanese history, with its ancient identity as the region of Wĕngkĕr. This is mentioned in the books Pararaton and Negara Kartagama (D.J Brandes, 1897). Etymologically, the name Wĕngkĕr derives from the phrase wĕngonan angker 'haunted place', which refers to the concept of a place filled with mystical and supernatural aura (Moelyadi, 1986). In the Serat Centhini, canto 213, as translated by Stein Callenfels, there is a narrative that strengthens the historical legacy of Panaraga, which asserts that Wĕngkĕr held an important position in the history of classical Javanese civilization and became the undeniable historical identity of Panaraga.\n\n Geographically, the Panaraga sub-ethnic group refers to the area in the western part of East Java Province, now known as Ponorogo Regency, stretching from the western side of Mount Wilis to eastern side of Mount Lawu. According to Junghuhn's records (1855), numerous altars and terraces resembling worship sites were discovered, which were considered by ancient Javanese society as the dwelling places of gods and sacred crowns. Valentijn (1862) provided a more detailed description that the Panaraga region stretched from Pacitan Bay on the southern coast to Sumbang Village with approximately 150 families, extending two miles east of Mount Lawu, bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south and Lodaya to the east, with the Semangi River in Sangkulang Village serving as an important geographical marker and Mount Wilis as a natural boundary between Panaraga, Nganjuk and Kediri.\n\n In sociocultural context, the Dutch Resident in Madiun, Lucien Adam (1938), provided interesting anthropological notes regarding the characteristics of the Panaraga sub-ethnic community: \n\n The mystery of the origin of the Panaraga people has not been clearly revealed. Although they do not live in isolation from the surrounding areas, their types and characters differ from surrounding districts. People from Panaraga are more independent and self-confident, but also tough, brave, reckless, quick-tempered, and prefer to travel compared to average people in central Java.\n\n Adam's observations reveal the unique temperament of the Panaraga ethnic group, which differs from the general Javanese ethnic group, possessing an independent, brave, and highly adventurous spirit, represented by the figure of Warok as their sociocultural identity. Terminologically, Warok comes from the word waro'i or wirangi, which means 'already understands both physically and spiritually, whose actions are solely to help others', or from the word wewarah (Arabic: wara') which means 'to distance oneself from doubtful things', thus Warok can be interpreted as individual with supernatural power who uses their abilities for social good and holds a high status in Panaraga society. \n\n The existence of Warok cannot be separated from the art of reyog—both are like two sides of a coin united in the ethnic identity of Panaraga. The word reyog itself has various debated interpretations, ranging from the onomatopoeic hypothesis of the riyeg-riyeg bamboo sound to Mbah Wo Kucing's philosophical interpretation, which states REYOG as an acronym for five spiritual elements (R: rasa kidung (feeling of song), E: engwang sukma adiluhung (noble soul's essence), Y: Yang Widhi (The Divine), O: olah kridhaning Gusti (the Lord's creative act), G: gelar gumulung kĕrsaning Kang Maha Kuasa (the unfolding of the Almighty's will)), which means that reyog is not merely a performing art but a spiritual medium that connects humans with the divine dimension through artistic expression rich in the philosophical values of the Ponorogo community.\n\nRegardless of various etymological interpretations, the art of reyog was born from a complex socio-political context as a form of criticism by Warok Ki Ageng Kutu Suryaalam against the Majapahit government under the rule of King Brawijaya V, which was considered overly dominated by the queen consort. The phenomenon is symbolized in the form of singa barong or dadak merak—a tiger's head with a peacock's neck—which represents a subtle satire of a leadership that has lost its direction and power. \n\nPanaraga, with its historical and cultural identity, offers a unique depiction of cultural complexity within the mosaic of Javanese culture, featuring Warok as a central figure and reyog as an artistic expression rich in cultural and philosophical meaning. Therefore, this cultural heritage not only becomes a historical asset but also a living identity that must be continuously preserved by future generations as the proud ethnic identity of Panaraga.",

            "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Tengger in Old Javanese means “highlands” (Gericke and Roorda, 1901:918), and thus the meaning of Wong Tengger would have mean persons who lived in highlands. In nowadays Java, Tengger no longer refer to that, but cover to “perch and sit above” (Hefner, 1985:25). Wong Tengger ‘Tengger People’ are indigenous community who resides and surrounds around the slope of Mountain Brahma (Bromo). The Tengger highlands locates to the northeast from Malang. There are three gates to reach there: (1) the first route is going to the north from Malang to Pasuruan or Purwodadi, we will find the main entrance Wonokitri village in Tosari district and going up to the Ngadiwono village. These regions well known as western side (brang kulon) of Tengger highlands; (2) the second route is heading to Probolinggo, we will reach the main entrance is Cemoro Lawang village (Ngadisari district) and directly overlooks mount Bromo and Tengger caldera. These gates are popularly known as eastern side (brang wetan) of Tengger highlands; (3) the third access has two kinds of gates: (1) heading to Tumpang, Malang then we will reach the Gubugklakah, and the main gate is Ngadas village; (2) heading to Lumajang, and climbing to Senduro, Ranupani. These regions are known as southern (brang kidul) of Tengger highlands.\n\nHong hulun Basuki Langgeng\n\nHong Hulun Basuki Langgeng is Tenggerese salutation. This formula consists of four words in Old Javenese: Oṅ or Om is often referred to mantra or formula praise; ṅhulun is the usual pronoun for the first person (Zoetmulder:1982). Whilst the rest of the words are still existed in modern Javanese, basuki means well-being, and laṅgĕṅ holds the meaning permanent. So, the Tenggerese salutation can be interpreted in the following: “Om, (Brahmā, Visnū, Sivā), I wish for eternal well-being”. Then, the receiver will reply: basuki laṅgĕṅ ‘well-being forever’. This salutation is given when someone visit their relatives by knocking the door or for maintaining social relationship among Tenggerese when they meet each other in market or climbing up to the Bromo.\n\nDukun Panḍita as divine actors \n\nIn order to maintain the divine relationship between the people of Tengger and their deities and ancestor, the role of dukun panḍita (priest of Tengger) is central (Sukmawan, 2022:14). In the rituals that they perform, the priest is acting like the middleman who mediate the realm world to divine world. By uttering their formulas (mantra) and mentioning the means of the ritual, the priest communicates to the unseen figures to the man who dedicated their offerings to their deities or ancestors. In all the rituals that are performed by Tenggerese, the priest is the main actor. Tenggerese often call the name of the dukun as Rama. Every Tengger villages has dukun and the assistant of the dukun. dukun as Rama. Every Tengger villages has dukun and the assistant of the dukun.",

            "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Panaraga is an area that has been etched into the collective memory of Javanese history, with its ancient identity as the region of Wĕngkĕr. This is mentioned in the books Pararaton and Negara Kartagama (D.J Brandes, 1897). Etymologically, the name Wĕngkĕr derives from the phrase wĕngonan angker 'haunted place', which refers to the concept of a place filled with mystical and supernatural aura (Moelyadi, 1986). In the Serat Centhini, canto 213, as translated by Stein Callenfels, there is a narrative that strengthens the historical legacy of Panaraga, which asserts that Wĕngkĕr held an important position in the history of classical Javanese civilization and became the undeniable historical identity of Panaraga.\n\n Geographically, the Panaraga sub-ethnic group refers to the area in the western part of East Java Province, now known as Ponorogo Regency, stretching from the western side of Mount Wilis to eastern side of Mount Lawu. According to Junghuhn's records (1855), numerous altars and terraces resembling worship sites were discovered, which were considered by ancient Javanese society as the dwelling places of gods and sacred crowns.

            "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Panaraga is an area that has been etched into the collective memory of Javanese history, with its ancient identity as the region of Wĕngkĕr. This is mentioned in the books Pararaton and Negara Kartagama (D.J Brandes, 1897). Etymologically, the name Wĕngkĕr derives from the phrase wĕngonan angker 'haunted place', which refers to the concept of a place filled with mystical and supernatural aura (Moelyadi, 1986). In the Serat Centhini, canto 213, as translated by Stein Callenfels, there is a narrative that strengthens the historical legacy of Panaraga, which asserts that Wĕngkĕr held an important position in the history of classical Javanese civilization and became the undeniable historical identity of Panaraga.\n\n Geographically, the Panaraga sub-ethnic group refers to the area in the western part of East Java Province, now known as Ponorogo Regency, stretching from the western side of Mount Wilis to eastern side of Mount Lawu. According to Junghuhn's records (1855), numerous altars and terraces resembling worship sites were discovered, which were considered by ancient Javanese society as the dwelling places of gods and sacred crowns. Valentijn (1862) provided a more detailed description that the Panaraga region stretched from Pacitan Bay on the southern coast to Sumbang Village with approximately 150 families, extending two miles east of Mount Lawu, bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south and Lodaya to the east, with the Semangi River in Sangkulang Village serving as an important geographical marker and Mount Wilis as a natural boundary between Panaraga, Nganjuk and Kediri.\n\n In sociocultural context, the Dutch Resident in Madiun, Lucien Adam (1938), provided interesting anthropological notes regarding the characteristics of the Panaraga sub-ethnic community: \n\n The mystery of the origin of the Panaraga people has not been clearly revealed. Although they do not live in isolation from the surrounding areas, their types and characters differ from surrounding districts. People from Panaraga are more independent and self-confident, but also tough, brave, reckless, quick-tempered, and prefer to travel compared to average people in central Java.\n\n Adam's observations reveal the unique temperament of the Panaraga ethnic group, which differs from the general Javanese ethnic group, possessing an independent, brave, and highly adventurous spirit, represented by the figure of Warok as their sociocultural identity. Terminologically, Warok comes from the word waro'i or wirangi, which means 'already understands both physically and spiritually, whose actions are solely to help others', or from the word wewarah (Arabic: wara') which means 'to distance oneself from doubtful things', thus Warok can be interpreted as individual with supernatural power who uses their abilities for social good and holds a high status in Panaraga society. \n\n The existence of Warok cannot be separated from the art of reyog—both are like two sides of a coin united in the ethnic identity of Panaraga. The word reyog itself has various debated interpretations, ranging from the onomatopoeic hypothesis of the riyeg-riyeg bamboo sound to Mbah Wo Kucing's philosophical interpretation, which states REYOG as an acronym for five spiritual elements (R: rasa kidung (feeling of song), E: engwang sukma adiluhung (noble soul's essence), Y: Yang Widhi (The Divine), O: olah kridhaning Gusti (the Lord's creative act), G: gelar gumulung kĕrsaning Kang Maha Kuasa (the unfolding of the Almighty's will)), which means that reyog is not merely a performing art but a spiritual medium that connects humans with the divine dimension through artistic expression rich in the philosophical values of the Ponorogo community.\n\nRegardless of various etymological interpretations, the art of reyog was born from a complex socio-political context as a form of criticism by Warok Ki Ageng Kutu Suryaalam against the Majapahit government under the rule of King Brawijaya V, which was considered overly dominated by the queen consort.

            "greetingMeaning": "\"Om, (Brahmā, Visnū, Sivā), I wish for eternal well-being\"",
            "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Tengger in Old Javanese means “highlands” (Gericke and Roorda, 1901:918), and thus the meaning of Wong Tengger would have mean persons who lived in highlands. In nowadays Java, Tengger no longer refer to that, but cover to “perch and sit above” (Hefner, 1985:25). Wong Tengger ‘Tengger People’ are indigenous community who resides and surrounds around the slope of Mountain Brahma (Bromo). The Tengger highlands locates to the northeast from Malang. There are three gates to reach there: (1) the first route is going to the north from Malang to Pasuruan or Purwodadi, we will find the main entrance Wonokitri village in Tosari district and going up to the Ngadiwono village. These regions well known as western side (brang kulon) of Tengger highlands; (2) the second route is heading to Probolinggo, we will reach the main entrance is Cemoro Lawang village (Ngadisari district) and directly overlooks mount Bromo and Tengger caldera. These gates are popularly known as eastern side (brang wetan) of Tengger highlands; (3) the third access has two kinds of gates: (1) heading to Tumpang, Malang then we will reach the Gubugklakah, and the main gate is Ngadas village; (2) heading to Lumajang, and climbing to Senduro, Ranupani. These regions are known as southern (brang kidul) of Tengger highlands.\n\nHong hulun Basuki Langgeng\n\nHong Hulun Basuki Langgeng is Tenggerese salutation. This formula consists of four words in Old Javenese: Oṅ or Om is often referred to mantra or formula praise; ṅhulun is the usual pronoun for the first person (Zoetmulder:1982). Whilst the rest of the words are still existed in modern Javanese, basuki means well-being, and laṅgĕṅ holds the meaning permanent. So, the Tenggerese salutation can be interpreted in the following: “Om, (Brahmā, Visnū, Sivā), I wish for eternal well-being”. Then, the receiver will reply: basuki laṅgĕṅ ‘well-being forever’. This salutation is given when someone visit their relatives by knocking the door or for maintaining social relationship among Tenggerese when they meet each other in market or climbing up to the Bromo.\n\nDukun Panḍita as divine actors \n\nIn order to maintain the divine relationship between the people of Tengger and their deities and ancestor, the role of dukun panḍita (priest of Tengger) is central (Sukmawan, 2022:14). In the rituals that they perform, the priest is acting like the middleman who mediate the realm world to divine world. By uttering their formulas (mantra) and mentioning the means of the ritual, the priest communicates to the unseen figures to the man who dedicated their offerings to their deities or ancestors. In all the rituals that are performed by Tenggerese, the priest is the main actor. Tenggerese often call the name of the dukun as Rama. Every Tengger villages has dukun and the assistant of the dukun. dukun as Rama. Every Tengger villages has dukun and the assistant of the dukun.",

        "culturalMeaning": "“Pujan, From the Sanskrit and Old Javanese term for \"worship,\" Tengger pujan are celebrated in the fourth, eighth, ninth, and twelfth months of the Tengger calendar year; several villages celebrate a fifth pujan in the seventh month, in addition. Once marked by feasting at the village priest's house, pujan today involve a brief invocation and meal at the priest's house. Supported by food contributions from all households in the village, attendance is restricted to village officials and the priest” (Hefner, 1989:112-113).\n\"The pujan illustrates this pattern clearly, and also shows to what degree ordinary villagers are drawn into the ceremony... The actual ritual service—a more or less standard invocation of the gods—lasts only about five minutes. The remainder of the evening is devoted to the meal... The pujan circuit is completed the following morning. Trays of cooked food (ater-ater) are sent from the priest’s house to village officials, and small earth offerings are set out by the roadside, cemetery, bridge, and other locations around the village.\" (Hefner, 1985: 114).\n\"Manusia harus mengadakan pujan pada bulan purnama, tilem, galungan, panawangan, kasada, dan kapitu. Jika pujan dilaksanakan, Durga-Kala tidak akan mengganggu manusia. Ketiga Dewa tersebut terus-menerus mengajari manusia cara memuja dan memberikan sesaji kepada Durga-Kala sebagai manifestasi Sang Hyang Widhi.\" (Sukmawan, 2018:123).",
        "commonMeaning": "Pujan adalah ritual pemujaan masyarakat Tengger yang berakar dari kata Sanskerta dan Jawa Kuno puja (‘penghormatan, penyembahan, dan doa’). Ritual ini merupakan bagian dari kalender desa yang dilaksanakan pada bulan tertentu setiap tahun. Dahulu berupa perjamuan besar di rumah dukun pendeta desa, kini pujan berlangsung sebagai doa singkat dan jamuan simbolik yang dihadiri pendeta serta pejabat desa dengan dukungan makanan warga. Rangkaian pujan ditutup dengan pengiriman hidangan kepada tokoh desa dan persembahan kecil di tempat sakral sebagai wujud keterlibatan spiritual komunitas.",
        "translation": "Pujan is a worship ritual of the Tengger community. The name rooted in the Sanskrit and Old Javanese word puja (‘respect, worship, and prayer’). This ritual is within the village calendar and is held in certain month every year. In the past, Pujan took the form of a grand feast at the village priest’s house. Today, pujan is held as a brief prayer and symbolic banquet attended by priests and village officials, with food contributed by the community. The series of pujan concludes with the distribution of dishes to village leaders and small offerings at sacred sites as a manifestation of the community’s spiritual involvement.",
        "variant": "Dalam bahasa Jawa klasik dan krama, puja berarti penghormatan, doa, atau sembah, dengan turunan morfologis seperti pujan (sarana atau hasil pemujaan) dan pêpujan (yang dipuja atau diagungkan). Di Tengger, pujan terspesifikasi menjadi ritual kolektif yang terikat pada siklus waktu dan struktur sosial desa, bersifat khas, dan tidak ditemukan pada komunitas Jawa lain. Meski berkerabat dengan selametan atau kenduren, pujan berbeda dalam penanggalan, peran dukun desa, dan tata persembahan yang lebih terstruktur. Dalam praktik Hindu dan Buddha, puja tetap berarti sembahyang, tetapi tanpa dimensi sosial-komunal sebagaimana di Tengger. Pujan juga telah bertransformasi dari perjamuan besar yang terbuka menjadi doa simbolik terbatas, meski tetap menuntut kontribusi kolektif. Perubahan ini mencerminkan adaptasi terhadap modernitas, dengan makna inti sebagai penghormatan ilahiah dan penjaga harmoni desa yang tetap lestari.",
        "variantTranslations": "In classical and krama Javanese (honorifics), puja denotes reverence, prayer, or worship, with related morphological forms such as pujan (the means or outcome of worship) and pêpujan (that which is worshipped or glorified). Among Tengger people, pujan has evolved into a distinctive collective ritual tied to the cycle of time and the village’s social structure, a practice unique to this community and not found elsewhere in Java. While related to selametan or kenduren, pujan differs in its calendar, the role of the village shaman, and the more structured nature of its offerings. In Hindu and Buddhist contexts, puja continues to signify prayer, though without the socio-communal dimension characteristic of Tengger. Over time, pujan has shifted from a large, open-air feast to a more limited, symbolic form of prayer, while still requiring collective contributions. These transformations reflect adaptation to modernity, preserving both its core meaning of divine reverence and the maintenance of sustainable village harmony.",

            "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Tengger in Old Javanese means “highlands” (Gericke and Roorda, 1901:918), and thus the meaning of Wong Tengger would have mean persons who lived in highlands. In nowadays Java, Tengger no longer refer to that, but cover to “perch and sit above” (Hefner, 1985:25). Wong Tengger ‘Tengger People’ are indigenous community who resides and surrounds around the slope of Mountain Brahma (Bromo). The Tengger highlands locates to the northeast from Malang. There are three gates to reach there: (1) the first route is going to the north from Malang to Pasuruan or Purwodadi, we will find the main entrance Wonokitri village in Tosari district and going up to the Ngadiwono village. These regions well known as western side (brang kulon) of Tengger highlands; (2) the second route is heading to Probolinggo, we will reach the main entrance is Cemoro Lawang village (Ngadisari district) and directly overlooks mount Bromo and Tengger caldera. These gates are popularly known as eastern side (brang wetan) of Tengger highlands; (3) the third access has two kinds of gates: (1) heading to Tumpang, Malang then we will reach the Gubugklakah, and the main gate is Ngadas village; (2) heading to Lumajang, and climbing to Senduro, Ranupani. These regions are known as southern (brang kidul) of Tengger highlands.\n\nHong hulun Basuki Langgeng\n\nHong Hulun Basuki Langgeng is Tenggerese salutation. This formula consists of four words in Old Javenese: Oṅ or Om is often referred to mantra or formula praise; ṅhulun is the usual pronoun for the first person (Zoetmulder:1982). Whilst the rest of the words are still existed in modern Javanese, basuki means well-being, and laṅgĕṅ holds the meaning permanent. So, the Tenggerese salutation can be interpreted in the following: “Om, (Brahmā, Visnū, Sivā), I wish for eternal well-being”. Then, the receiver will reply: basuki laṅgĕṅ ‘well-being forever’. This salutation is given when someone visit their relatives by knocking the door or for maintaining social relationship among Tenggerese when they meet each other in market or climbing up to the Bromo.\n\nDukun Panḍita as divine actors \n\nIn order to maintain the divine relationship between the people of Tengger and their deities and ancestor, the role of dukun panḍita (priest of Tengger) is central (Sukmawan, 2022:14). In the rituals that they perform, the priest is acting like the middleman who mediate the realm world to divine world. By uttering their formulas (mantra) and mentioning the means of the ritual, the priest communicates to the unseen figures to the man who dedicated their offerings to their deities or ancestors. In all the rituals that are performed by Tenggerese, the priest is the main actor. Tenggerese often call the name of the dukun as Rama. Every Tengger villages has dukun and the assistant of the dukun. dukun as Rama. Every Tengger villages has dukun and the assistant of the dukun.",

            "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Tengger in Old Javanese means “highlands” (Gericke and Roorda, 1901:918), and thus the meaning of Wong Tengger would have mean persons who lived in highlands. In nowadays Java, Tengger no longer refer to that, but cover to “perch and sit above” (Hefner, 1985:25). Wong Tengger ‘Tengger People’ are indigenous community who resides and surrounds around the slope of Mountain Brahma (Bromo). The Tengger highlands locates to the northeast from Malang. There are three gates to reach there: (1) the first route is going to the north from Malang to Pasuruan or Purwodadi, we will find the main entrance Wonokitri village in Tosari district and going up to the Ngadiwono village. These regions well known as western side (brang kulon) of Tengger highlands; (2) the second route is heading to Probolinggo, we will reach the main entrance is Cemoro Lawang village (Ngadisari district) and directly overlooks mount Bromo and Tengger caldera. These gates are popularly known as eastern side (brang wetan) of Tengger highlands; (3) the third access has two kinds of gates: (1) heading to Tumpang, Malang then we will reach the Gubugklakah, and the main gate is Ngadas village; (2) heading to Lumajang, and climbing to Senduro, Ranupani. These regions are known as southern (brang kidul) of Tengger highlands.\n\nHong hulun Basuki Langgeng\n\nHong Hulun Basuki Langgeng is Tenggerese salutation. This formula consists of four words in Old Javenese: Oṅ or Om is often referred to mantra or formula praise; ṅhulun is the usual pronoun for the first person (Zoetmulder:1982). Whilst the rest of the words are still existed in modern Javanese, basuki means well-being, and laṅgĕṅ holds the meaning permanent. So, the Tenggerese salutation can be interpreted in the following: “Om, (Brahmā, Visnū, Sivā), I wish for eternal well-being”. Then, the receiver will reply: basuki laṅgĕṅ ‘well-being forever’. This salutation is given when someone visit their relatives by knocking the door or for maintaining social relationship among Tenggerese when they meet each other in market or climbing up to the Bromo.\n\nDukun Panḍita as divine actors \n\nIn order to maintain the divine relationship between the people of Tengger and their deities and ancestor, the role of dukun panḍita (priest of Tengger) is central (Sukmawan, 2022:14).

            "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Panaraga is an area that has been etched into the collective memory of Javanese history, with its ancient identity as the region of Wĕngkĕr. This is mentioned in the books Pararaton and Negara Kartagama (D.J Brandes, 1897). Etymologically, the name Wĕngkĕr derives from the phrase wĕngonan angker 'haunted place', which refers to the concept of a place filled with mystical and supernatural aura (Moelyadi, 1986). In the Serat Centhini, canto 213, as translated by Stein Callenfels, there is a narrative that strengthens the historical legacy of Panaraga, which asserts that Wĕngkĕr held an important position in the history of classical Javanese civilization and became the undeniable historical identity of Panaraga.\n\n Geographically, the Panaraga sub-ethnic group refers to the area in the western part of East Java Province, now known as Ponorogo Regency, stretching from the western side of Mount Wilis to eastern side of Mount Lawu. According to Junghuhn's records (1855), numerous altars and terraces resembling worship sites were discovered, which were considered by ancient Javanese society as the dwelling places of gods and sacred crowns. Valentijn (1862) provided a more detailed description that the Panaraga region stretched from Pacitan Bay on the southern coast to Sumbang Village with approximately 150 families, extending two miles east of Mount Lawu, bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south and Lodaya to the east, with the Semangi River in Sangkulang Village serving as an important geographical marker and Mount Wilis as a natural boundary between Panaraga, Nganjuk and Kediri.\n\n In sociocultural context, the Dutch Resident in Madiun, Lucien Adam (1938), provided interesting anthropological notes regarding the characteristics of the Panaraga sub-ethnic community: \n\n The mystery of the origin of the Panaraga people has not been clearly revealed. Although they do not live in isolation from the surrounding areas, their types and characters differ from surrounding districts. People from Panaraga are more independent and self-confident, but also tough, brave, reckless, quick-tempered, and prefer to travel compared to average people in central Java.\n\n Adam's observations reveal the unique temperament of the Panaraga ethnic group, which differs from the general Javanese ethnic group, possessing an independent, brave, and highly adventurous spirit, represented by the figure of Warok as their sociocultural identity. Terminologically, Warok comes from the word waro'i or wirangi, which means 'already understands both physically and spiritually, whose actions are solely to help others', or from the word wewarah (Arabic: wara') which means 'to distance oneself from doubtful things', thus Warok can be interpreted as individual with supernatural power who uses their abilities for social good and holds a high status in Panaraga society. \n\n The existence of Warok cannot be separated from the art of reyog—both are like two sides of a coin united in the ethnic identity of Panaraga. The word reyog itself has various debated interpretations, ranging from the onomatopoeic hypothesis of the riyeg-riyeg bamboo sound to Mbah Wo Kucing's philosophical interpretation, which states REYOG as an acronym for five spiritual elements (R: rasa kidung (feeling of song), E: engwang sukma adiluhung (noble soul's essence), Y: Yang Widhi (The Divine), O: olah kridhaning Gusti (the Lord's creative act), G: gelar gumulung kĕrsaning Kang Maha Kuasa (the unfolding of the Almighty's will)), which means that reyog is not merely a performing art but a spiritual medium that connects humans with the divine dimension through artistic expression rich in the philosophical values of the Ponorogo community.\n\nRegardless of various etymological interpretations, the art of reyog was born from a complex socio-political context as a form of criticism by Warok Ki Ageng Kutu Suryaalam against the Majapahit government under the rule of King Brawijaya V, which was considered overly dominated by the queen consort. The phenomenon is symbolized in the form of singa barong or dadak merak—a tiger's head with a peacock's neck—which represents a subtle satire of a leadership that has lost its direction and power. \n\nPanaraga, with its historical and cultural identity, offers a unique depiction of cultural complexity within the mosaic of Javanese culture, featuring Warok as a central figure and reyog as an artistic expression rich in cultural and philosophical meaning. Therefore, this cultural heritage not only becomes a historical asset but also a living identity that must be continuously preserved by future generations as the proud ethnic identity of Panaraga.",

            "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Panaraga is an area that has been etched into the collective memory of Javanese history, with its ancient identity as the region of Wĕngkĕr. This is mentioned in the books Pararaton and Negara Kartagama (D.J Brandes, 1897). Etymologically, the name Wĕngkĕr derives from the phrase wĕngonan angker 'haunted place', which refers to the concept of a place filled with mystical and supernatural aura (Moelyadi, 1986). In the Serat Centhini, canto 213, as translated by Stein Callenfels, there is a narrative that strengthens the historical legacy of Panaraga, which asserts that Wĕngkĕr held an important position in the history of classical Javanese civilization and became the undeniable historical identity of Panaraga.\n\n Geographically, the Panaraga sub-ethnic group refers to the area in the western part of East Java Province, now known as Ponorogo Regency, stretching from the western side of Mount Wilis to eastern side of Mount Lawu. According to Junghuhn's records (1855), numerous altars and terraces resembling worship sites were discovered, which were considered by ancient Javanese society as the dwelling places of gods and sacred crowns. Valentijn (1862) provided a more detailed description that the Panaraga region stretched from Pacitan Bay on the southern coast to Sumbang Village with approximately 150 families, extending two miles east of Mount Lawu, bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south and Lodaya to the east, with the Semangi River in Sangkulang Village serving as an important geographical marker and Mount Wilis as a natural boundary between Panaraga, Nganjuk and Kediri.\n\n In sociocultural context, the Dutch Resident in Madiun, Lucien Adam (1938), provided interesting anthropological notes regarding the characteristics of the Panaraga sub-ethnic community: \n\n The mystery of the origin of the Panaraga people has not been clearly revealed. Although they do not live in isolation from the surrounding areas, their types and characters differ from surrounding districts. People from Panaraga are more independent and self-confident, but also tough, brave, reckless, quick-tempered, and prefer to travel compared to average people in central Java.\n\n Adam's observations reveal the unique temperament of the Panaraga ethnic group, which differs from the general Javanese ethnic group, possessing an independent, brave, and highly adventurous spirit, represented by the figure of Warok as their sociocultural identity. Terminologically, Warok comes from the word waro'i or wirangi, which means 'already understands both physically and spiritually, whose actions are solely to help others', or from the word wewarah (Arabic: wara') which means 'to distance oneself from doubtful things', thus Warok can be interpreted as individual with supernatural power who uses their abilities for social good and holds a high status in Panaraga society. \n\n The existence of Warok cannot be separated from the art of reyog—both are like two sides of a coin united in the ethnic identity of Panaraga. The word reyog itself has various debated interpretations, ranging from the onomatopoeic hypothesis of the riyeg-riyeg bamboo sound to Mbah Wo Kucing's philosophical interpretation, which states REYOG as an acronym for five spiritual elements (R: rasa kidung (feeling of song), E: engwang sukma adiluhung (noble soul's essence), Y: Yang Widhi (The Divine), O: olah kridhaning Gusti (the Lord's creative act), G: gelar gumulung kĕrsaning Kang Maha Kuasa (the unfolding of the Almighty's will)), which means that reyog is not merely a performing art but a spiritual medium that connects humans with the divine dimension through artistic expression rich in the philosophical values of the Ponorogo community.\n\nRegardless of various etymological interpretations, the art of reyog was born from a complex socio-political context as a form of criticism by Warok Ki Ageng Kutu Suryaalam against the Majapahit government under the rule of King Brawijaya V, which was considered overly dominated by the queen consort. The phenomenon is symbolized in the form of singa barong or dadak merak—a tiger's head with a peacock's neck—which represents a subtle satire of a leadership that has lost its direction and power. \n\nPanaraga, with its historical and cultural identity, offers a unique depiction of cultural complexity within the mosaic of Javanese culture, featuring Warok as a central figure and reyog as an artistic expression rich in cultural and philosophical meaning. Therefore, this cultural heritage not only becomes a historical asset but also a living identity that must be continuously preserved by future generations as the proud ethnic identity of Panaraga.",

            "greetingMeaning": "\"Om, (Brahmā, Visnū, Sivā), I wish for eternal well-being\"",
            "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Tengger in Old Javanese means “highlands” (Gericke and Roorda, 1901:918), and thus the meaning of Wong Tengger would have mean persons who lived in highlands. In nowadays Java, Tengger no longer refer to that, but cover to “perch and sit above” (Hefner, 1985:25). Wong Tengger ‘Tengger People’ are indigenous community who resides and surrounds around the slope of Mountain Brahma (Bromo). The Tengger highlands locates to the northeast from Malang. There are three gates to reach there: (1) the first route is going to the north from Malang to Pasuruan or Purwodadi, we will find the main entrance Wonokitri village in Tosari district and going up to the Ngadiwono village. These regions well known as western side (brang kulon) of Tengger highlands; (2) the second route is heading to Probolinggo, we will reach the main entrance is Cemoro Lawang village (Ngadisari district) and directly overlooks mount Bromo and Tengger caldera. These gates are popularly known as eastern side (brang wetan) of Tengger highlands; (3) the third access has two kinds of gates: (1) heading to Tumpang, Malang then we will reach the Gubugklakah, and the main gate is Ngadas village; (2) heading to Lumajang, and climbing to Senduro, Ranupani. These regions are known as southern (brang kidul) of Tengger highlands.\n\nHong hulun Basuki Langgeng\n\nHong Hulun Basuki Langgeng is Tenggerese salutation. This formula consists of four words in Old Javenese: Oṅ or Om is often referred to mantra or formula praise; ṅhulun is the usual pronoun for the first person (Zoetmulder:1982).

In nowadays Java, Tengger no longer refer to that, but cover to “perch and sit above” (Hefner, 1985:25). Wong Tengger ‘Tengger People’ are indigenous community who resides and surrounds around the slope of Mountain Brahma (Bromo). The Tengger highlands locates to the northeast from Malang. There are three gates to reach there: (1) the first route is going to the north from Malang to Pasuruan or Purwodadi, we will find the main entrance Wonokitri village in Tosari district and going up to the Ngadiwono village.

These gates are popularly known as eastern side (brang wetan) of Tengger highlands; (3) the third access has two kinds of gates: (1) heading to Tumpang, Malang then we will reach the Gubugklakah, and the main gate is Ngadas village; (2) heading to Lumajang, and climbing to Senduro, Ranupani.

            "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Tengger in Old Javanese means “highlands” (Gericke and Roorda, 1901:918), and thus the meaning of Wong Tengger would have mean persons who lived in highlands. In nowadays Java, Tengger no longer refer to that, but cover to “perch and sit above” (Hefner, 1985:25). Wong Tengger ‘Tengger People’ are indigenous community who resides and surrounds around the slope of Mountain Brahma (Bromo). The Tengger highlands locates to the northeast from Malang. There are three gates to reach there: (1) the first route is going to the north from Malang to Pasuruan or Purwodadi, we will find the main entrance Wonokitri village in Tosari district and going up to the Ngadiwono village. These regions well known as western side (brang kulon) of Tengger highlands; (2) the second route is heading to Probolinggo, we will reach the main entrance is Cemoro Lawang village (Ngadisari district) and directly overlooks mount Bromo and Tengger caldera. These gates are popularly known as eastern side (brang wetan) of Tengger highlands; (3) the third access has two kinds of gates: (1) heading to Tumpang, Malang then we will reach the Gubugklakah, and the main gate is Ngadas village; (2) heading to Lumajang, and climbing to Senduro, Ranupani. These regions are known as southern (brang kidul) of Tengger highlands.\n\nHong hulun Basuki Langgeng\n\nHong Hulun Basuki Langgeng is Tenggerese salutation. This formula consists of four words in Old Javenese: Oṅ or Om is often referred to mantra or formula praise; ṅhulun is the usual pronoun for the first person (Zoetmulder:1982). Whilst the rest of the words are still existed in modern Javanese, basuki means well-being, and laṅgĕṅ holds the meaning permanent. So, the Tenggerese salutation can be interpreted in the following: “Om, (Brahmā, Visnū, Sivā), I wish for eternal well-being”. Then, the receiver will reply: basuki laṅgĕṅ ‘well-being forever’. This salutation is given when someone visit their relatives by knocking the door or for maintaining social relationship among Tenggerese when they meet each other in market or climbing up to the Bromo.\n\nDukun Panḍita as divine actors \n\nIn order to maintain the divine relationship between the people of Tengger and their deities and ancestor, the role of dukun panḍita (priest of Tengger) is central (Sukmawan, 2022:14). In the rituals that they perform, the priest is acting like the middleman who mediate the realm world to divine world. By uttering their formulas (mantra) and mentioning the means of the ritual, the priest communicates to the unseen figures to the man who dedicated their offerings to their deities or ancestors. In all the rituals that are performed by Tenggerese, the priest is the main actor. Tenggerese often call the name of the dukun as Rama. Every Tengger villages has dukun and the assistant of the dukun. dukun as Rama. Every Tengger villages has dukun and the assistant of the dukun.",

            "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Panaraga is an area that has been etched into the collective memory of Javanese history, with its ancient identity as the region of Wĕngkĕr. This is mentioned in the books Pararaton and Negara Kartagama (D.J Brandes, 1897). Etymologically, the name Wĕngkĕr derives from the phrase wĕngonan angker 'haunted place', which refers to the concept of a place filled with mystical and supernatural aura (Moelyadi, 1986). In the Serat Centhini, canto 213, as translated by Stein Callenfels, there is a narrative that strengthens the historical legacy of Panaraga, which asserts that Wĕngkĕr held an important position in the history of classical Javanese civilization and became the undeniable historical identity of Panaraga.\n\n Geographically, the Panaraga sub-ethnic group refers to the area in the western part of East Java Province, now known as Ponorogo Regency, stretching from the western side of Mount Wilis to eastern side of Mount Lawu. According to Junghuhn's records (1855), numerous altars and terraces resembling worship sites were discovered, which were considered by ancient Javanese society as the dwelling places of gods and sacred crowns. Valentijn (1862) provided a more detailed description that the Panaraga region stretched from Pacitan Bay on the southern coast to Sumbang Village with approximately 150 families, extending two miles east of Mount Lawu, bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south and Lodaya to the east, with the Semangi River in Sangkulang Village serving as an important geographical marker and Mount Wilis as a natural boundary between Panaraga, Nganjuk and Kediri.\n\n In sociocultural context, the Dutch Resident in Madiun, Lucien Adam (1938), provided interesting anthropological notes regarding the characteristics of the Panaraga sub-ethnic community: \n\n The mystery of the origin of the Panaraga people has not been clearly revealed. Although they do not live in isolation from the surrounding areas, their types and characters differ from surrounding districts. People from Panaraga are more independent and self-confident, but also tough, brave, reckless, quick-tempered, and prefer to travel compared to average people in central Java.\n\n Adam's observations reveal the unique temperament of the Panaraga ethnic group, which differs from the general Javanese ethnic group, possessing an independent, brave, and highly adventurous spirit, represented by the figure of Warok as their sociocultural identity. Terminologically, Warok comes from the word waro'i or wirangi, which means 'already understands both physically and spiritually, whose actions are solely to help others', or from the word wewarah (Arabic: wara') which means 'to distance oneself from doubtful things', thus Warok can be interpreted as individual with supernatural power who uses their abilities for social good and holds a high status in Panaraga society. \n\n The existence of Warok cannot be separated from the art of reyog—both are like two sides of a coin united in the ethnic identity of Panaraga. The word reyog itself has various debated interpretations, ranging from the onomatopoeic hypothesis of the riyeg-riyeg bamboo sound to Mbah Wo Kucing's philosophical interpretation, which states REYOG as an acronym for five spiritual elements (R: rasa kidung (feeling of song), E: engwang sukma adiluhung (noble soul's essence), Y: Yang Widhi (The Divine), O: olah kridhaning Gusti (the Lord's creative act), G: gelar gumulung kĕrsaning Kang Maha Kuasa (the unfolding of the Almighty's will)), which means that reyog is not merely a performing art but a spiritual medium that connects humans with the divine dimension through artistic expression rich in the philosophical values of the Ponorogo community.\n\nRegardless of various etymological interpretations, the art of reyog was born from a complex socio-political context as a form of criticism by Warok Ki Ageng Kutu Suryaalam against the Majapahit government under the rule of King Brawijaya V, which was considered overly dominated by the queen consort. The phenomenon is symbolized in the form of singa barong or dadak merak—a tiger's head with a peacock's neck—which represents a subtle satire of a leadership that has lost its direction and power. \n\nPanaraga, with its historical and cultural identity, offers a unique depiction of cultural complexity within the mosaic of Javanese culture, featuring Warok as a central figure and reyog as an artistic expression rich in cultural and philosophical meaning. Therefore, this cultural heritage not only becomes a historical asset but also a living identity that must be continuously preserved by future generations as the proud ethnic identity of Panaraga.",

            "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Tengger in Old Javanese means “highlands” (Gericke and Roorda, 1901:918), and thus the meaning of Wong Tengger would have mean persons who lived in highlands. In nowadays Java, Tengger no longer refer to that, but cover to “perch and sit above” (Hefner, 1985:25). Wong Tengger ‘Tengger People’ are indigenous community who resides and surrounds around the slope of Mountain Brahma (Bromo). The Tengger highlands locates to the northeast from Malang. There are three gates to reach there: (1) the first route is going to the north from Malang to Pasuruan or Purwodadi, we will find the main entrance Wonokitri village in Tosari district and going up to the Ngadiwono village. These regions well known as western side (brang kulon) of Tengger highlands; (2) the second route is heading to Probolinggo, we will reach the main entrance is Cemoro Lawang village (Ngadisari district) and directly overlooks mount Bromo and Tengger caldera. These gates are popularly known as eastern side (brang wetan) of Tengger highlands; (3) the third access has two kinds of gates: (1) heading to Tumpang, Malang then we will reach the Gubugklakah, and the main gate is Ngadas village; (2) heading to Lumajang, and climbing to Senduro, Ranupani. These regions are known as southern (brang kidul) of Tengger highlands.\n\nHong hulun Basuki Langgeng\n\nHong Hulun Basuki Langgeng is Tenggerese salutation. This formula consists of four words in Old Javenese: Oṅ or Om is often referred to mantra or formula praise; ṅhulun is the usual pronoun for the first person (Zoetmulder:1982). Whilst the rest of the words are still existed in modern Javanese, basuki means well-being, and laṅgĕṅ holds the meaning permanent. So, the Tenggerese salutation can be interpreted in the following: “Om, (Brahmā, Visnū, Sivā), I wish for eternal well-being”. Then, the receiver will reply: basuki laṅgĕṅ ‘well-being forever’. This salutation is given when someone visit their relatives by knocking the door or for maintaining social relationship among Tenggerese when they meet each other in market or climbing up to the Bromo.\n\nDukun Panḍita as divine actors \n\nIn order to maintain the divine relationship between the people of Tengger and their deities and ancestor, the role of dukun panḍita (priest of Tengger) is central (Sukmawan, 2022:14). In the rituals that they perform, the priest is acting like the middleman who mediate the realm world to divine world. By uttering their formulas (mantra) and mentioning the means of the ritual, the priest communicates to the unseen figures to the man who dedicated their offerings to their deities or ancestors. In all the rituals that are performed by Tenggerese, the priest is the main actor. Tenggerese often call the name of the dukun as Rama. Every Tengger villages has dukun and the assistant of the dukun. dukun as Rama. Every Tengger villages has dukun and the assistant of the dukun.",

            "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Tengger in Old Javanese means “highlands” (Gericke and Roorda, 1901:918), and thus the meaning of Wong Tengger would have mean persons who lived in highlands. In nowadays Java, Tengger no longer refer to that, but cover to “perch and sit above” (Hefner, 1985:25). Wong Tengger ‘Tengger People’ are indigenous community who resides and surrounds around the slope of Mountain Brahma (Bromo). The Tengger highlands locates to the northeast from Malang. There are three gates to reach there: (1) the first route is going to the north from Malang to Pasuruan or Purwodadi, we will find the main entrance Wonokitri village in Tosari district and going up to the Ngadiwono village. These regions well known as western side (brang kulon) of Tengger highlands; (2) the second route is heading to Probolinggo, we will reach the main entrance is Cemoro Lawang village (Ngadisari district) and directly overlooks mount Bromo and Tengger caldera. These gates are popularly known as eastern side (brang wetan) of Tengger highlands; (3) the third access has two kinds of gates: (1) heading to Tumpang, Malang then we will reach the Gubugklakah, and the main gate is Ngadas village; (2) heading to Lumajang, and climbing to Senduro, Ranupani. These regions are known as southern (brang kidul) of Tengger highlands.\n\nHong hulun Basuki Langgeng\n\nHong Hulun Basuki Langgeng is Tenggerese salutation. This formula consists of four words in Old Javenese: Oṅ or Om is often referred to mantra or formula praise; ṅhulun is the usual pronoun for the first person (Zoetmulder:1982). Whilst the rest of the words are still existed in modern Javanese, basuki means well-being, and laṅgĕṅ holds the meaning permanent. So, the Tenggerese salutation can be interpreted in the following: “Om, (Brahmā, Visnū, Sivā), I wish for eternal well-being”. Then, the receiver will reply: basuki laṅgĕṅ ‘well-being forever’. This salutation is given when someone visit their relatives by knocking the door or for maintaining social relationship among Tenggerese when they meet each other in market or climbing up to the Bromo.\n\nDukun Panḍita as divine actors \n\nIn order to maintain the divine relationship between the people of Tengger and their deities and ancestor, the role of dukun panḍita (priest of Tengger) is central (Sukmawan, 2022:14). In the rituals that they perform, the priest is acting like the middleman who mediate the realm world to divine world. By uttering their formulas (mantra) and mentioning the means of the ritual, the priest communicates to the unseen figures to the man who dedicated their offerings to their deities or ancestors. In all the rituals that are performed by Tenggerese, the priest is the main actor. Tenggerese often call the name of the dukun as Rama. Every Tengger villages has dukun and the assistant of the dukun. dukun as Rama. Every Tengger villages has dukun and the assistant of the dukun.",

            "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Panaraga is an area that has been etched into the collective memory of Javanese history, with its ancient identity as the region of Wĕngkĕr. This is mentioned in the books Pararaton and Negara Kartagama (D.J Brandes, 1897). Etymologically, the name Wĕngkĕr derives from the phrase wĕngonan angker 'haunted place', which refers to the concept of a place filled with mystical and supernatural aura (Moelyadi, 1986). In the Serat Centhini, canto 213, as translated by Stein Callenfels, there is a narrative that strengthens the historical legacy of Panaraga, which asserts that Wĕngkĕr held an important position in the history of classical Javanese civilization and became the undeniable historical identity of Panaraga.\n\n Geographically, the Panaraga sub-ethnic group refers to the area in the western part of East Java Province, now known as Ponorogo Regency, stretching from the western side of Mount Wilis to eastern side of Mount Lawu. According to Junghuhn's records (1855), numerous altars and terraces resembling worship sites were discovered, which were considered by ancient Javanese society as the dwelling places of gods and sacred crowns. Valentijn (1862) provided a more detailed description that the Panaraga region stretched from Pacitan Bay on the southern coast to Sumbang Village with approximately 150 families, extending two miles east of Mount Lawu, bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south and Lodaya to the east, with the Semangi River in Sangkulang Village serving as an important geographical marker and Mount Wilis as a natural boundary between Panaraga, Nganjuk and Kediri.\n\n In sociocultural context, the Dutch Resident in Madiun, Lucien Adam (1938), provided interesting anthropological notes regarding the characteristics of the Panaraga sub-ethnic community: \n\n The mystery of the origin of the Panaraga people has not been clearly revealed. Although they do not live in isolation from the surrounding areas, their types and characters differ from surrounding districts. People from Panaraga are more independent and self-confident, but also tough, brave, reckless, quick-tempered, and prefer to travel compared to average people in central Java.\n\n Adam's observations reveal the unique temperament of the Panaraga ethnic group, which differs from the general Javanese ethnic group, possessing an independent, brave, and highly adventurous spirit, represented by the figure of Warok as their sociocultural identity. Terminologically, Warok comes from the word waro'i or wirangi, which means 'already understands both physically and spiritually, whose actions are solely to help others', or from the word wewarah (Arabic: wara') which means 'to distance oneself from doubtful things', thus Warok can be interpreted as individual with supernatural power who uses their abilities for social good and holds a high status in Panaraga society. \n\n The existence of Warok cannot be separated from the art of reyog—both are like two sides of a coin united in the ethnic identity of Panaraga. The word reyog itself has various debated interpretations, ranging from the onomatopoeic hypothesis of the riyeg-riyeg bamboo sound to Mbah Wo Kucing's philosophical interpretation, which states REYOG as an acronym for five spiritual elements (R: rasa kidung (feeling of song), E: engwang sukma adiluhung (noble soul's essence), Y: Yang Widhi (The Divine), O: olah kridhaning Gusti (the Lord's creative act), G: gelar gumulung kĕrsaning Kang Maha Kuasa (the unfolding of the Almighty's will)), which means that reyog is not merely a performing art but a spiritual medium that connects humans with the divine dimension through artistic expression rich in the philosophical values of the Ponorogo community.\n\nRegardless of various etymological interpretations, the art of reyog was born from a complex socio-political context as a form of criticism by Warok Ki Ageng Kutu Suryaalam against the Majapahit government under the rule of King Brawijaya V, which was considered overly dominated by the queen consort. The phenomenon is symbolized in the form of singa barong or dadak merak—a tiger's head with a peacock's neck—which represents a subtle satire of a leadership that has lost its direction and power. \n\nPanaraga, with its historical and cultural identity, offers a unique depiction of cultural complexity within the mosaic of Javanese culture, featuring Warok as a central figure and reyog as an artistic expression rich in cultural and philosophical meaning. Therefore, this cultural heritage not only becomes a historical asset but also a living identity that must be continuously preserved by future generations as the proud ethnic identity of Panaraga.",

The word reyog itself has various debated interpretations, ranging from the onomatopoeic hypothesis of the riyeg-riyeg bamboo sound to Mbah Wo Kucing's philosophical interpretation, which states REYOG as an acronym for five spiritual elements (R: rasa kidung (feeling of song), E: engwang sukma adiluhung (noble soul's essence), Y: Yang Widhi (The Divine), O: olah kridhaning Gusti (the Lord's creative act), G: gelar gumulung kĕrsaning Kang Maha Kuasa (the unfolding of the Almighty's will)), which means that reyog is not merely a performing art but a spiritual medium that connects humans with the divine dimension through artistic expression rich in the philosophical values of the Ponorogo community.\n\nRegardless of various etymological interpretations, the art of reyog was born from a complex socio-political context as a form of criticism by Warok Ki Ageng Kutu Suryaalam against the Majapahit government under the rule of King Brawijaya V, which was considered overly dominated by the queen consort. The phenomenon is symbolized in the form of singa barong or dadak merak—a tiger's head with a peacock's neck—which represents a subtle satire of a leadership that has lost its direction and power. \n\nPanaraga, with its historical and cultural identity, offers a unique depiction of cultural complexity within the mosaic of Javanese culture, featuring Warok as a central figure and reyog as an artistic expression rich in cultural and philosophical meaning. Therefore, this cultural heritage not only becomes a historical asset but also a living identity that must be continuously preserved by future generations as the proud ethnic identity of Panaraga.",

            "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Panaraga is an area that has been etched into the collective memory of Javanese history, with its ancient identity as the region of Wĕngkĕr. This is mentioned in the books Pararaton and Negara Kartagama (D.J Brandes, 1897). Etymologically, the name Wĕngkĕr derives from the phrase wĕngonan angker 'haunted place', which refers to the concept of a place filled with mystical and supernatural aura (Moelyadi, 1986). In the Serat Centhini, canto 213, as translated by Stein Callenfels, there is a narrative that strengthens the historical legacy of Panaraga, which asserts that Wĕngkĕr held an important position in the history of classical Javanese civilization and became the undeniable historical identity of Panaraga.\n\n Geographically, the Panaraga sub-ethnic group refers to the area in the western part of East Java Province, now known as Ponorogo Regency, stretching from the western side of Mount Wilis to eastern side of Mount Lawu. According to Junghuhn's records (1855), numerous altars and terraces resembling worship sites were discovered, which were considered by ancient Javanese society as the dwelling places of gods and sacred crowns. Valentijn (1862) provided a more detailed description that the Panaraga region stretched from Pacitan Bay on the southern coast to Sumbang Village with approximately 150 families, extending two miles east of Mount Lawu, bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south and Lodaya to the east, with the Semangi River in Sangkulang Village serving as an important geographical marker and Mount Wilis as a natural boundary between Panaraga, Nganjuk and Kediri.\n\n In sociocultural context, the Dutch Resident in Madiun, Lucien Adam (1938), provided interesting anthropological notes regarding the characteristics of the Panaraga sub-ethnic community: \n\n The mystery of the origin of the Panaraga people has not been clearly revealed. Although they do not live in isolation from the surrounding areas, their types and characters differ from surrounding districts. People from Panaraga are more independent and self-confident, but also tough, brave, reckless, quick-tempered, and prefer to travel compared to average people in central Java.\n\n Adam's observations reveal the unique temperament of the Panaraga ethnic group, which differs from the general Javanese ethnic group, possessing an independent, brave, and highly adventurous spirit, represented by the figure of Warok as their sociocultural identity.

In the Serat Centhini, canto 213, as translated by Stein Callenfels, there is a narrative that strengthens the historical legacy of Panaraga, which asserts that Wĕngkĕr held an important position in the history of classical Javanese civilization and became the undeniable historical identity of Panaraga.\n\n Geographically, the Panaraga sub-ethnic group refers to the area in the western part of East Java Province, now known as Ponorogo Regency, stretching from the western side of Mount Wilis to eastern side of Mount Lawu. According to Junghuhn's records (1855), numerous altars and terraces resembling worship sites were discovered, which were considered by ancient Javanese society as the dwelling places of gods and sacred crowns. Valentijn (1862) provided a more detailed description that the Panaraga region stretched from Pacitan Bay on the southern coast to Sumbang Village with approximately 150 families, extending two miles east of Mount Lawu, bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south and Lodaya to the east, with the Semangi River in Sangkulang Village serving as an important geographical marker and Mount Wilis as a natural boundary between Panaraga, Nganjuk and Kediri.\n\n In sociocultural context, the Dutch Resident in Madiun, Lucien Adam (1938), provided interesting anthropological notes regarding the characteristics of the Panaraga sub-ethnic community: \n\n The mystery of the origin of the Panaraga people has not been clearly revealed. Although they do not live in isolation from the surrounding areas, their types and characters differ from surrounding districts. People from Panaraga are more independent and self-confident, but also tough, brave, reckless, quick-tempered, and prefer to travel compared to average people in central Java.\n\n Adam's observations reveal the unique temperament of the Panaraga ethnic group, which differs from the general Javanese ethnic group, possessing an independent, brave, and highly adventurous spirit, represented by the figure of Warok as their sociocultural identity. Terminologically, Warok comes from the word waro'i or wirangi, which means 'already understands both physically and spiritually, whose actions are solely to help others', or from the word wewarah (Arabic: wara') which means 'to distance oneself from doubtful things', thus Warok can be interpreted as individual with supernatural power who uses their abilities for social good and holds a high status in Panaraga society. \n\n The existence of Warok cannot be separated from the art of reyog—both are like two sides of a coin united in the ethnic identity of Panaraga. The word reyog itself has various debated interpretations, ranging from the onomatopoeic hypothesis of the riyeg-riyeg bamboo sound to Mbah Wo Kucing's philosophical interpretation, which states REYOG as an acronym for five spiritual elements (R: rasa kidung (feeling of song), E: engwang sukma adiluhung (noble soul's essence), Y: Yang Widhi (The Divine), O: olah kridhaning Gusti (the Lord's creative act), G: gelar gumulung kĕrsaning Kang Maha Kuasa (the unfolding of the Almighty's will)), which means that reyog is not merely a performing art but a spiritual medium that connects humans with the divine dimension through artistic expression rich in the philosophical values of the Ponorogo community.\n\nRegardless of various etymological interpretations, the art of reyog was born from a complex socio-political context as a form of criticism by Warok Ki Ageng Kutu Suryaalam against the Majapahit government under the rule of King Brawijaya V, which was considered overly dominated by the queen consort. The phenomenon is symbolized in the form of singa barong or dadak merak—a tiger's head with a peacock's neck—which represents a subtle satire of a leadership that has lost its direction and power. \n\nPanaraga, with its historical and cultural identity, offers a unique depiction of cultural complexity within the mosaic of Javanese culture, featuring Warok as a central figure and reyog as an artistic expression rich in cultural and philosophical meaning. Therefore, this cultural heritage not only becomes a historical asset but also a living identity that must be continuously preserved by future generations as the proud ethnic identity of Panaraga.",

            "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Panaraga is an area that has been etched into the collective memory of Javanese history, with its ancient identity as the region of Wĕngkĕr. This is mentioned in the books Pararaton and Negara Kartagama (D.J Brandes, 1897). Etymologically, the name Wĕngkĕr derives from the phrase wĕngonan angker 'haunted place', which refers to the concept of a place filled with mystical and supernatural aura (Moelyadi, 1986). In the Serat Centhini, canto 213, as translated by Stein Callenfels, there is a narrative that strengthens the historical legacy of Panaraga, which asserts that Wĕngkĕr held an important position in the history of classical Javanese civilization and became the undeniable historical identity of Panaraga.\n\n Geographically, the Panaraga sub-ethnic group refers to the area in the western part of East Java Province, now known as Ponorogo Regency, stretching from the western side of Mount Wilis to eastern side of Mount Lawu. According to Junghuhn's records (1855), numerous altars and terraces resembling worship sites were discovered, which were considered by ancient Javanese society as the dwelling places of gods and sacred crowns. Valentijn (1862) provided a more detailed description that the Panaraga region stretched from Pacitan Bay on the southern coast to Sumbang Village with approximately 150 families, extending two miles east of Mount Lawu, bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south and Lodaya to the east, with the Semangi River in Sangkulang Village serving as an important geographical marker and Mount Wilis as a natural boundary between Panaraga, Nganjuk and Kediri.\n\n In sociocultural context, the Dutch Resident in Madiun, Lucien Adam (1938), provided interesting anthropological notes regarding the characteristics of the Panaraga sub-ethnic community: \n\n The mystery of the origin of the Panaraga people has not been clearly revealed. Although they do not live in isolation from the surrounding areas, their types and characters differ from surrounding districts. People from Panaraga are more independent and self-confident, but also tough, brave, reckless, quick-tempered, and prefer to travel compared to average people in central Java.\n\n Adam's observations reveal the unique temperament of the Panaraga ethnic group, which differs from the general Javanese ethnic group, possessing an independent, brave, and highly adventurous spirit, represented by the figure of Warok as their sociocultural identity. Terminologically, Warok comes from the word waro'i or wirangi, which means 'already understands both physically and spiritually, whose actions are solely to help others', or from the word wewarah (Arabic: wara') which means 'to distance oneself from doubtful things', thus Warok can be interpreted as individual with supernatural power who uses their abilities for social good and holds a high status in Panaraga society. \n\n The existence of Warok cannot be separated from the art of reyog—both are like two sides of a coin united in the ethnic identity of Panaraga. The word reyog itself has various debated interpretations, ranging from the onomatopoeic hypothesis of the riyeg-riyeg bamboo sound to Mbah Wo Kucing's philosophical interpretation, which states REYOG as an acronym for five spiritual elements (R: rasa kidung (feeling of song), E: engwang sukma adiluhung (noble soul's essence), Y: Yang Widhi (The Divine), O: olah kridhaning Gusti (the Lord's creative act), G: gelar gumulung kĕrsaning Kang Maha Kuasa (the unfolding of the Almighty's will)), which means that reyog is not merely a performing art but a spiritual medium that connects humans with the divine dimension through artistic expression rich in the philosophical values of the Ponorogo community.\n\nRegardless of various etymological interpretations, the art of reyog was born from a complex socio-political context as a form of criticism by Warok Ki Ageng Kutu Suryaalam against the Majapahit government under the rule of King Brawijaya V, which was considered overly dominated by the queen consort. The phenomenon is symbolized in the form of singa barong or dadak merak—a tiger's head with a peacock's neck—which represents a subtle satire of a leadership that has lost its direction and power. \n\nPanaraga, with its historical and cultural identity, offers a unique depiction of cultural complexity within the mosaic of Javanese culture, featuring Warok as a central figure and reyog as an artistic expression rich in cultural and philosophical meaning. Therefore, this cultural heritage not only becomes a historical asset but also a living identity that must be continuously preserved by future generations as the proud ethnic identity of Panaraga.",

            "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Panaraga is an area that has been etched into the collective memory of Javanese history, with its ancient identity as the region of Wĕngkĕr. This is mentioned in the books Pararaton and Negara Kartagama (D.J Brandes, 1897). Etymologically, the name Wĕngkĕr derives from the phrase wĕngonan angker 'haunted place', which refers to the concept of a place filled with mystical and supernatural aura (Moelyadi, 1986). In the Serat Centhini, canto 213, as translated by Stein Callenfels, there is a narrative that strengthens the historical legacy of Panaraga, which asserts that Wĕngkĕr held an important position in the history of classical Javanese civilization and became the undeniable historical identity of Panaraga.\n\n Geographically, the Panaraga sub-ethnic group refers to the area in the western part of East Java Province, now known as Ponorogo Regency, stretching from the western side of Mount Wilis to eastern side of Mount Lawu. According to Junghuhn's records (1855), numerous altars and terraces resembling worship sites were discovered, which were considered by ancient Javanese society as the dwelling places of gods and sacred crowns. Valentijn (1862) provided a more detailed description that the Panaraga region stretched from Pacitan Bay on the southern coast to Sumbang Village with approximately 150 families, extending two miles east of Mount Lawu, bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south and Lodaya to the east, with the Semangi River in Sangkulang Village serving as an important geographical marker and Mount Wilis as a natural boundary between Panaraga, Nganjuk and Kediri.\n\n In sociocultural context, the Dutch Resident in Madiun, Lucien Adam (1938), provided interesting anthropological notes regarding the characteristics of the Panaraga sub-ethnic community: \n\n The mystery of the origin of the Panaraga people has not been clearly revealed. Although they do not live in isolation from the surrounding areas, their types and characters differ from surrounding districts. People from Panaraga are more independent and self-confident, but also tough, brave, reckless, quick-tempered, and prefer to travel compared to average people in central Java.\n\n Adam's observations reveal the unique temperament of the Panaraga ethnic group, which differs from the general Javanese ethnic group, possessing an independent, brave, and highly adventurous spirit, represented by the figure of Warok as their sociocultural identity. Terminologically, Warok comes from the word waro'i or wirangi, which means 'already understands both physically and spiritually, whose actions are solely to help others', or from the word wewarah (Arabic: wara') which means 'to distance oneself from doubtful things', thus Warok can be interpreted as individual with supernatural power who uses their abilities for social good and holds a high status in Panaraga society. \n\n The existence of Warok cannot be separated from the art of reyog—both are like two sides of a coin united in the ethnic identity of Panaraga. The word reyog itself has various debated interpretations, ranging from the onomatopoeic hypothesis of the riyeg-riyeg bamboo sound to Mbah Wo Kucing's philosophical interpretation, which states REYOG as an acronym for five spiritual elements (R: rasa kidung (feeling of song), E: engwang sukma adiluhung (noble soul's essence), Y: Yang Widhi (The Divine), O: olah kridhaning Gusti (the Lord's creative act), G: gelar gumulung kĕrsaning Kang Maha Kuasa (the unfolding of the Almighty's will)), which means that reyog is not merely a performing art but a spiritual medium that connects humans with the divine dimension through artistic expression rich in the philosophical values of the Ponorogo community.\n\nRegardless of various etymological interpretations, the art of reyog was born from a complex socio-political context as a form of criticism by Warok Ki Ageng Kutu Suryaalam against the Majapahit government under the rule of King Brawijaya V, which was considered overly dominated by the queen consort. The phenomenon is symbolized in the form of singa barong or dadak merak—a tiger's head with a peacock's neck—which represents a subtle satire of a leadership that has lost its direction and power. \n\nPanaraga, with its historical and cultural identity, offers a unique depiction of cultural complexity within the mosaic of Javanese culture, featuring Warok as a central figure and reyog as an artistic expression rich in cultural and philosophical meaning. Therefore, this cultural heritage not only becomes a historical asset but also a living identity that must be continuously preserved by future generations as the proud ethnic identity of Panaraga.",

            "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Panaraga is an area that has been etched into the collective memory of Javanese history, with its ancient identity as the region of Wĕngkĕr. This is mentioned in the books Pararaton and Negara Kartagama (D.J Brandes, 1897). Etymologically, the name Wĕngkĕr derives from the phrase wĕngonan angker 'haunted place', which refers to the concept of a place filled with mystical and supernatural aura (Moelyadi, 1986). In the Serat Centhini, canto 213, as translated by Stein Callenfels, there is a narrative that strengthens the historical legacy of Panaraga, which asserts that Wĕngkĕr held an important position in the history of classical Javanese civilization and became the undeniable historical identity of Panaraga.\n\n Geographically, the Panaraga sub-ethnic group refers to the area in the western part of East Java Province, now known as Ponorogo Regency, stretching from the western side of Mount Wilis to eastern side of Mount Lawu. According to Junghuhn's records (1855), numerous altars and terraces resembling worship sites were discovered, which were considered by ancient Javanese society as the dwelling places of gods and sacred crowns. Valentijn (1862) provided a more detailed description that the Panaraga region stretched from Pacitan Bay on the southern coast to Sumbang Village with approximately 150 families, extending two miles east of Mount Lawu, bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south and Lodaya to the east, with the Semangi River in Sangkulang Village serving as an important geographical marker and Mount Wilis as a natural boundary between Panaraga, Nganjuk and Kediri.\n\n In sociocultural context, the Dutch Resident in Madiun, Lucien Adam (1938), provided interesting anthropological notes regarding the characteristics of the Panaraga sub-ethnic community: \n\n The mystery of the origin of the Panaraga people has not been clearly revealed. Although they do not live in isolation from the surrounding areas, their types and characters differ from surrounding districts. People from Panaraga are more independent and self-confident, but also tough, brave, reckless, quick-tempered, and prefer to travel compared to average people in central Java.\n\n Adam's observations reveal the unique temperament of the Panaraga ethnic group, which differs from the general Javanese ethnic group, possessing an independent, brave, and highly adventurous spirit, represented by the figure of Warok as their sociocultural identity. Terminologically, Warok comes from the word waro'i or wirangi, which means 'already understands both physically and spiritually, whose actions are solely to help others', or from the word wewarah (Arabic: wara') which means 'to distance oneself from doubtful things', thus Warok can be interpreted as individual with supernatural power who uses their abilities for social good and holds a high status in Panaraga society. \n\n The existence of Warok cannot be separated from the art of reyog—both are like two sides of a coin united in the ethnic identity of Panaraga. The word reyog itself has various debated interpretations, ranging from the onomatopoeic hypothesis of the riyeg-riyeg bamboo sound to Mbah Wo Kucing's philosophical interpretation, which states REYOG as an acronym for five spiritual elements (R: rasa kidung (feeling of song), E: engwang sukma adiluhung (noble soul's essence), Y: Yang Widhi (The Divine), O: olah kridhaning Gusti (the Lord's creative act), G: gelar gumulung kĕrsaning Kang Maha Kuasa (the unfolding of the Almighty's will)), which means that reyog is not merely a performing art but a spiritual medium that connects humans with the divine dimension through artistic expression rich in the philosophical values of the Ponorogo community.\n\nRegardless of various etymological interpretations, the art of reyog was born from a complex socio-political context as a form of criticism by Warok Ki Ageng Kutu Suryaalam against the Majapahit government under the rule of King Brawijaya V, which was considered overly dominated by the queen consort. The phenomenon is symbolized in the form of singa barong or dadak merak—a tiger's head with a peacock's neck—which represents a subtle satire of a leadership that has lost its direction and power. \n\nPanaraga, with its historical and cultural identity, offers a unique depiction of cultural complexity within the mosaic of Javanese culture, featuring Warok as a central figure and reyog as an artistic expression rich in cultural and philosophical meaning. Therefore, this cultural heritage not only becomes a historical asset but also a living identity that must be continuously preserved by future generations as the proud ethnic identity of Panaraga.",

            "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Panaraga is an area that has been etched into the collective memory of Javanese history, with its ancient identity as the region of Wĕngkĕr. This is mentioned in the books Pararaton and Negara Kartagama (D.J Brandes, 1897). Etymologically, the name Wĕngkĕr derives from the phrase wĕngonan angker 'haunted place', which refers to the concept of a place filled with mystical and supernatural aura (Moelyadi, 1986). In the Serat Centhini, canto 213, as translated by Stein Callenfels, there is a narrative that strengthens the historical legacy of Panaraga, which asserts that Wĕngkĕr held an important position in the history of classical Javanese civilization and became the undeniable historical identity of Panaraga.\n\n Geographically, the Panaraga sub-ethnic group refers to the area in the western part of East Java Province, now known as Ponorogo Regency, stretching from the western side of Mount Wilis to eastern side of Mount Lawu. According to Junghuhn's records (1855), numerous altars and terraces resembling worship sites were discovered, which were considered by ancient Javanese society as the dwelling places of gods and sacred crowns. Valentijn (1862) provided a more detailed description that the Panaraga region stretched from Pacitan Bay on the southern coast to Sumbang Village with approximately 150 families, extending two miles east of Mount Lawu, bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south and Lodaya to the east, with the Semangi River in Sangkulang Village serving as an important geographical marker and Mount Wilis as a natural boundary between Panaraga, Nganjuk and Kediri.\n\n In sociocultural context, the Dutch Resident in Madiun, Lucien Adam (1938), provided interesting anthropological notes regarding the characteristics of the Panaraga sub-ethnic community: \n\n The mystery of the origin of the Panaraga people has not been clearly revealed. Although they do not live in isolation from the surrounding areas, their types and characters differ from surrounding districts. People from Panaraga are more independent and self-confident, but also tough, brave, reckless, quick-tempered, and prefer to travel compared to average people in central Java.\n\n Adam's observations reveal the unique temperament of the Panaraga ethnic group, which differs from the general Javanese ethnic group, possessing an independent, brave, and highly adventurous spirit, represented by the figure of Warok as their sociocultural identity. Terminologically, Warok comes from the word waro'i or wirangi, which means 'already understands both physically and spiritually, whose actions are solely to help others', or from the word wewarah (Arabic: wara') which means 'to distance oneself from doubtful things', thus Warok can be interpreted as individual with supernatural power who uses their abilities for social good and holds a high status in Panaraga society. \n\n The existence of Warok cannot be separated from the art of reyog—both are like two sides of a coin united in the ethnic identity of Panaraga. The word reyog itself has various debated interpretations, ranging from the onomatopoeic hypothesis of the riyeg-riyeg bamboo sound to Mbah Wo Kucing's philosophical interpretation, which states REYOG as an acronym for five spiritual elements (R: rasa kidung (feeling of song), E: engwang sukma adiluhung (noble soul's essence), Y: Yang Widhi (The Divine), O: olah kridhaning Gusti (the Lord's creative act), G: gelar gumulung kĕrsaning Kang Maha Kuasa (the unfolding of the Almighty's will)), which means that reyog is not merely a performing art but a spiritual medium that connects humans with the divine dimension through artistic expression rich in the philosophical values of the Ponorogo community.\n\nRegardless of various etymological interpretations, the art of reyog was born from a complex socio-political context as a form of criticism by Warok Ki Ageng Kutu Suryaalam against the Majapahit government under the rule of King Brawijaya V, which was considered overly dominated by the queen consort. The phenomenon is symbolized in the form of singa barong or dadak merak—a tiger's head with a peacock's neck—which represents a subtle satire of a leadership that has lost its direction and power. \n\nPanaraga, with its historical and cultural identity, offers a unique depiction of cultural complexity within the mosaic of Javanese culture, featuring Warok as a central figure and reyog as an artistic expression rich in cultural and philosophical meaning. Therefore, this cultural heritage not only becomes a historical asset but also a living identity that must be continuously preserved by future generations as the proud ethnic identity of Panaraga.",

Oleh karena itu, keberadaan warok sangat dihormati sehingga seringkali mereka dimintai bantuan spiritual oleh masyarakat dalam berbagai aktivitas seperti hajatan, pagelaran, maupun ritual adat tradisi. Menurut Poerwowidjoyo (1990) warok berasal dari kata waro’i atau wirangi (dalam bahasa Jawa) yang berarti wis pana wis ngerti banget, marang agal alus lahir batin, tumindake mung kangge tetulung marang liyan ‘sudah paham, terhadap lahir dan batin, tindakannya hanya untuk menolong orang lain’. Berdasarkan pengertian tersebut, dapat disimpulkan bahwa seorang warok memiliki kemampuan supranatural atau kesaktian yang di gunakan untuk menolong sesama. Pendapat lain mengenai istilah waro berasal dari kata wewarah. Kata wewarah dari bahasa arab wara yang berarti ‘menjauhkan diri dari segala syubhat’. Wewarah seringkali dimaknai wong kang sugih wewarah ‘orang yang kaya pentunjuk’. Seperti disinggung dalam banyak literatur, nilai-nilai filosofis sangat kental dalam kesenian Reog, termasuk konsep nama warok itu sendiri. ",

            "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Panaraga is an area that has been etched into the collective memory of Javanese history, with its ancient identity as the region of Wĕngkĕr. This is mentioned in the books Pararaton and Negara Kartagama (D.J Brandes, 1897). Etymologically, the name Wĕngkĕr derives from the phrase wĕngonan angker 'haunted place', which refers to the concept of a place filled with mystical and supernatural aura (Moelyadi, 1986). In the Serat Centhini, canto 213, as translated by Stein Callenfels, there is a narrative that strengthens the historical legacy of Panaraga, which asserts that Wĕngkĕr held an important position in the history of classical Javanese civilization and became the undeniable historical identity of Panaraga.\n\n Geographically, the Panaraga sub-ethnic group refers to the area in the western part of East Java Province, now known as Ponorogo Regency, stretching from the western side of Mount Wilis to eastern side of Mount Lawu. According to Junghuhn's records (1855), numerous altars and terraces resembling worship sites were discovered, which were considered by ancient Javanese society as the dwelling places of gods and sacred crowns. Valentijn (1862) provided a more detailed description that the Panaraga region stretched from Pacitan Bay on the southern coast to Sumbang Village with approximately 150 families, extending two miles east of Mount Lawu, bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south and Lodaya to the east, with the Semangi River in Sangkulang Village serving as an important geographical marker and Mount Wilis as a natural boundary between Panaraga, Nganjuk and Kediri.\n\n In sociocultural context, the Dutch Resident in Madiun, Lucien Adam (1938), provided interesting anthropological notes regarding the characteristics of the Panaraga sub-ethnic community: \n\n The mystery of the origin of the Panaraga people has not been clearly revealed. Although they do not live in isolation from the surrounding areas, their types and characters differ from surrounding districts. People from Panaraga are more independent and self-confident, but also tough, brave, reckless, quick-tempered, and prefer to travel compared to average people in central Java.\n\n Adam's observations reveal the unique temperament of the Panaraga ethnic group, which differs from the general Javanese ethnic group, possessing an independent, brave, and highly adventurous spirit, represented by the figure of Warok as their sociocultural identity. Terminologically, Warok comes from the word waro'i or wirangi, which means 'already understands both physically and spiritually, whose actions are solely to help others', or from the word wewarah (Arabic: wara') which means 'to distance oneself from doubtful things', thus Warok can be interpreted as individual with supernatural power who uses their abilities for social good and holds a high status in Panaraga society. \n\n The existence of Warok cannot be separated from the art of reyog—both are like two sides of a coin united in the ethnic identity of Panaraga. The word reyog itself has various debated interpretations, ranging from the onomatopoeic hypothesis of the riyeg-riyeg bamboo sound to Mbah Wo Kucing's philosophical interpretation, which states REYOG as an acronym for five spiritual elements (R: rasa kidung (feeling of song), E: engwang sukma adiluhung (noble soul's essence), Y: Yang Widhi (The Divine), O: olah kridhaning Gusti (the Lord's creative act), G: gelar gumulung kĕrsaning Kang Maha Kuasa (the unfolding of the Almighty's will)), which means that reyog is not merely a performing art but a spiritual medium that connects humans with the divine dimension through artistic expression rich in the philosophical values of the Ponorogo community.\n\nRegardless of various etymological interpretations, the art of reyog was born from a complex socio-political context as a form of criticism by Warok Ki Ageng Kutu Suryaalam against the Majapahit government under the rule of King Brawijaya V, which was considered overly dominated by the queen consort. The phenomenon is symbolized in the form of singa barong or dadak merak—a tiger's head with a peacock's neck—which represents a subtle satire of a leadership that has lost its direction and power. \n\nPanaraga, with its historical and cultural identity, offers a unique depiction of cultural complexity within the mosaic of Javanese culture, featuring Warok as a central figure and reyog as an artistic expression rich in cultural and philosophical meaning. Therefore, this cultural heritage not only becomes a historical asset but also a living identity that must be continuously preserved by future generations as the proud ethnic identity of Panaraga.",

            "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Panaraga is an area that has been etched into the collective memory of Javanese history, with its ancient identity as the region of Wĕngkĕr. This is mentioned in the books Pararaton and Negara Kartagama (D.J Brandes, 1897). Etymologically, the name Wĕngkĕr derives from the phrase wĕngonan angker 'haunted place', which refers to the concept of a place filled with mystical and supernatural aura (Moelyadi, 1986). In the Serat Centhini, canto 213, as translated by Stein Callenfels, there is a narrative that strengthens the historical legacy of Panaraga, which asserts that Wĕngkĕr held an important position in the history of classical Javanese civilization and became the undeniable historical identity of Panaraga.\n\n Geographically, the Panaraga sub-ethnic group refers to the area in the western part of East Java Province, now known as Ponorogo Regency, stretching from the western side of Mount Wilis to eastern side of Mount Lawu. According to Junghuhn's records (1855), numerous altars and terraces resembling worship sites were discovered, which were considered by ancient Javanese society as the dwelling places of gods and sacred crowns. Valentijn (1862) provided a more detailed description that the Panaraga region stretched from Pacitan Bay on the southern coast to Sumbang Village with approximately 150 families, extending two miles east of Mount Lawu, bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south and Lodaya to the east, with the Semangi River in Sangkulang Village serving as an important geographical marker and Mount Wilis as a natural boundary between Panaraga, Nganjuk and Kediri.\n\n In sociocultural context, the Dutch Resident in Madiun, Lucien Adam (1938), provided interesting anthropological notes regarding the characteristics of the Panaraga sub-ethnic community: \n\n The mystery of the origin of the Panaraga people has not been clearly revealed. Although they do not live in isolation from the surrounding areas, their types and characters differ from surrounding districts. People from Panaraga are more independent and self-confident, but also tough, brave, reckless, quick-tempered, and prefer to travel compared to average people in central Java.\n\n Adam's observations reveal the unique temperament of the Panaraga ethnic group, which differs from the general Javanese ethnic group, possessing an independent, brave, and highly adventurous spirit, represented by the figure of Warok as their sociocultural identity. Terminologically, Warok comes from the word waro'i or wirangi, which means 'already understands both physically and spiritually, whose actions are solely to help others', or from the word wewarah (Arabic: wara') which means 'to distance oneself from doubtful things', thus Warok can be interpreted as individual with supernatural power who uses their abilities for social good and holds a high status in Panaraga society. \n\n The existence of Warok cannot be separated from the art of reyog—both are like two sides of a coin united in the ethnic identity of Panaraga. The word reyog itself has various debated interpretations, ranging from the onomatopoeic hypothesis of the riyeg-riyeg bamboo sound to Mbah Wo Kucing's philosophical interpretation, which states REYOG as an acronym for five spiritual elements (R: rasa kidung (feeling of song), E: engwang sukma adiluhung (noble soul's essence), Y: Yang Widhi (The Divine), O: olah kridhaning Gusti (the Lord's creative act), G: gelar gumulung kĕrsaning Kang Maha Kuasa (the unfolding of the Almighty's will)), which means that reyog is not merely a performing art but a spiritual medium that connects humans with the divine dimension through artistic expression rich in the philosophical values of the Ponorogo community.\n\nRegardless of various etymological interpretations, the art of reyog was born from a complex socio-political context as a form of criticism by Warok Ki Ageng Kutu Suryaalam against the Majapahit government under the rule of King Brawijaya V, which was considered overly dominated by the queen consort. The phenomenon is symbolized in the form of singa barong or dadak merak—a tiger's head with a peacock's neck—which represents a subtle satire of a leadership that has lost its direction and power. \n\nPanaraga, with its historical and cultural identity, offers a unique depiction of cultural complexity within the mosaic of Javanese culture, featuring Warok as a central figure and reyog as an artistic expression rich in cultural and philosophical meaning. Therefore, this cultural heritage not only becomes a historical asset but also a living identity that must be continuously preserved by future generations as the proud ethnic identity of Panaraga.",

            "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Panaraga is an area that has been etched into the collective memory of Javanese history, with its ancient identity as the region of Wĕngkĕr. This is mentioned in the books Pararaton and Negara Kartagama (D.J Brandes, 1897). Etymologically, the name Wĕngkĕr derives from the phrase wĕngonan angker 'haunted place', which refers to the concept of a place filled with mystical and supernatural aura (Moelyadi, 1986). In the Serat Centhini, canto 213, as translated by Stein Callenfels, there is a narrative that strengthens the historical legacy of Panaraga, which asserts that Wĕngkĕr held an important position in the history of classical Javanese civilization and became the undeniable historical identity of Panaraga.\n\n Geographically, the Panaraga sub-ethnic group refers to the area in the western part of East Java Province, now known as Ponorogo Regency, stretching from the western side of Mount Wilis to eastern side of Mount Lawu. According to Junghuhn's records (1855), numerous altars and terraces resembling worship sites were discovered, which were considered by ancient Javanese society as the dwelling places of gods and sacred crowns. Valentijn (1862) provided a more detailed description that the Panaraga region stretched from Pacitan Bay on the southern coast to Sumbang Village with approximately 150 families, extending two miles east of Mount Lawu, bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south and Lodaya to the east, with the Semangi River in Sangkulang Village serving as an important geographical marker and Mount Wilis as a natural boundary between Panaraga, Nganjuk and Kediri.\n\n In sociocultural context, the Dutch Resident in Madiun, Lucien Adam (1938), provided interesting anthropological notes regarding the characteristics of the Panaraga sub-ethnic community: \n\n The mystery of the origin of the Panaraga people has not been clearly revealed. Although they do not live in isolation from the surrounding areas, their types and characters differ from surrounding districts. People from Panaraga are more independent and self-confident, but also tough, brave, reckless, quick-tempered, and prefer to travel compared to average people in central Java.\n\n Adam's observations reveal the unique temperament of the Panaraga ethnic group, which differs from the general Javanese ethnic group, possessing an independent, brave, and highly adventurous spirit, represented by the figure of Warok as their sociocultural identity. Terminologically, Warok comes from the word waro'i or wirangi, which means 'already understands both physically and spiritually, whose actions are solely to help others', or from the word wewarah (Arabic: wara') which means 'to distance oneself from doubtful things', thus Warok can be interpreted as individual with supernatural power who uses their abilities for social good and holds a high status in Panaraga society. \n\n The existence of Warok cannot be separated from the art of reyog—both are like two sides of a coin united in the ethnic identity of Panaraga. The word reyog itself has various debated interpretations, ranging from the onomatopoeic hypothesis of the riyeg-riyeg bamboo sound to Mbah Wo Kucing's philosophical interpretation, which states REYOG as an acronym for five spiritual elements (R: rasa kidung (feeling of song), E: engwang sukma adiluhung (noble soul's essence), Y: Yang Widhi (The Divine), O: olah kridhaning Gusti (the Lord's creative act), G: gelar gumulung kĕrsaning Kang Maha Kuasa (the unfolding of the Almighty's will)), which means that reyog is not merely a performing art but a spiritual medium that connects humans with the divine dimension through artistic expression rich in the philosophical values of the Ponorogo community.\n\nRegardless of various etymological interpretations, the art of reyog was born from a complex socio-political context as a form of criticism by Warok Ki Ageng Kutu Suryaalam against the Majapahit government under the rule of King Brawijaya V, which was considered overly dominated by the queen consort. The phenomenon is symbolized in the form of singa barong or dadak merak—a tiger's head with a peacock's neck—which represents a subtle satire of a leadership that has lost its direction and power. \n\nPanaraga, with its historical and cultural identity, offers a unique depiction of cultural complexity within the mosaic of Javanese culture, featuring Warok as a central figure and reyog as an artistic expression rich in cultural and philosophical meaning. Therefore, this cultural heritage not only becomes a historical asset but also a living identity that must be continuously preserved by future generations as the proud ethnic identity of Panaraga.",

In the Serat Centhini, canto 213, as translated by Stein Callenfels, there is a narrative that strengthens the historical legacy of Panaraga, which asserts that Wĕngkĕr held an important position in the history of classical Javanese civilization and became the undeniable historical identity of Panaraga.\n\n Geographically, the Panaraga sub-ethnic group refers to the area in the western part of East Java Province, now known as Ponorogo Regency, stretching from the western side of Mount Wilis to eastern side of Mount Lawu. According to Junghuhn's records (1855), numerous altars and terraces resembling worship sites were discovered, which were considered by ancient Javanese society as the dwelling places of gods and sacred crowns. Valentijn (1862) provided a more detailed description that the Panaraga region stretched from Pacitan Bay on the southern coast to Sumbang Village with approximately 150 families, extending two miles east of Mount Lawu, bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south and Lodaya to the east, with the Semangi River in Sangkulang Village serving as an important geographical marker and Mount Wilis as a natural boundary between Panaraga, Nganjuk and Kediri.\n\n In sociocultural context, the Dutch Resident in Madiun, Lucien Adam (1938), provided interesting anthropological notes regarding the characteristics of the Panaraga sub-ethnic community: \n\n The mystery of the origin of the Panaraga people has not been clearly revealed. Although they do not live in isolation from the surrounding areas, their types and characters differ from surrounding districts. People from Panaraga are more independent and self-confident, but also tough, brave, reckless, quick-tempered, and prefer to travel compared to average people in central Java.\n\n Adam's observations reveal the unique temperament of the Panaraga ethnic group, which differs from the general Javanese ethnic group, possessing an independent, brave, and highly adventurous spirit, represented by the figure of Warok as their sociocultural identity. Terminologically, Warok comes from the word waro'i or wirangi, which means 'already understands both physically and spiritually, whose actions are solely to help others', or from the word wewarah (Arabic: wara') which means 'to distance oneself from doubtful things', thus Warok can be interpreted as individual with supernatural power who uses their abilities for social good and holds a high status in Panaraga society. \n\n The existence of Warok cannot be separated from the art of reyog—both are like two sides of a coin united in the ethnic identity of Panaraga. The word reyog itself has various debated interpretations, ranging from the onomatopoeic hypothesis of the riyeg-riyeg bamboo sound to Mbah Wo Kucing's philosophical interpretation, which states REYOG as an acronym for five spiritual elements (R: rasa kidung (feeling of song), E: engwang sukma adiluhung (noble soul's essence), Y: Yang Widhi (The Divine), O: olah kridhaning Gusti (the Lord's creative act), G: gelar gumulung kĕrsaning Kang Maha Kuasa (the unfolding of the Almighty's will)), which means that reyog is not merely a performing art but a spiritual medium that connects humans with the divine dimension through artistic expression rich in the philosophical values of the Ponorogo community.\n\nRegardless of various etymological interpretations, the art of reyog was born from a complex socio-political context as a form of criticism by Warok Ki Ageng Kutu Suryaalam against the Majapahit government under the rule of King Brawijaya V, which was considered overly dominated by the queen consort. The phenomenon is symbolized in the form of singa barong or dadak merak—a tiger's head with a peacock's neck—which represents a subtle satire of a leadership that has lost its direction and power. \n\nPanaraga, with its historical and cultural identity, offers a unique depiction of cultural complexity within the mosaic of Javanese culture, featuring Warok as a central figure and reyog as an artistic expression rich in cultural and philosophical meaning. Therefore, this cultural heritage not only becomes a historical asset but also a living identity that must be continuously preserved by future generations as the proud ethnic identity of Panaraga.",

            "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Panaraga is an area that has been etched into the collective memory of Javanese history, with its ancient identity as the region of Wĕngkĕr. This is mentioned in the books Pararaton and Negara Kartagama (D.J Brandes, 1897). Etymologically, the name Wĕngkĕr derives from the phrase wĕngonan angker 'haunted place', which refers to the concept of a place filled with mystical and supernatural aura (Moelyadi, 1986). In the Serat Centhini, canto 213, as translated by Stein Callenfels, there is a narrative that strengthens the historical legacy of Panaraga, which asserts that Wĕngkĕr held an important position in the history of classical Javanese civilization and became the undeniable historical identity of Panaraga.\n\n Geographically, the Panaraga sub-ethnic group refers to the area in the western part of East Java Province, now known as Ponorogo Regency, stretching from the western side of Mount Wilis to eastern side of Mount Lawu. According to Junghuhn's records (1855), numerous altars and terraces resembling worship sites were discovered, which were considered by ancient Javanese society as the dwelling places of gods and sacred crowns. Valentijn (1862) provided a more detailed description that the Panaraga region stretched from Pacitan Bay on the southern coast to Sumbang Village with approximately 150 families, extending two miles east of Mount Lawu, bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south and Lodaya to the east, with the Semangi River in Sangkulang Village serving as an important geographical marker and Mount Wilis as a natural boundary between Panaraga, Nganjuk and Kediri.\n\n In sociocultural context, the Dutch Resident in Madiun, Lucien Adam (1938), provided interesting anthropological notes regarding the characteristics of the Panaraga sub-ethnic community: \n\n The mystery of the origin of the Panaraga people has not been clearly revealed. Although they do not live in isolation from the surrounding areas, their types and characters differ from surrounding districts. People from Panaraga are more independent and self-confident, but also tough, brave, reckless, quick-tempered, and prefer to travel compared to average people in central Java.\n\n Adam's observations reveal the unique temperament of the Panaraga ethnic group, which differs from the general Javanese ethnic group, possessing an independent, brave, and highly adventurous spirit, represented by the figure of Warok as their sociocultural identity. Terminologically, Warok comes from the word waro'i or wirangi, which means 'already understands both physically and spiritually, whose actions are solely to help others', or from the word wewarah (Arabic: wara') which means 'to distance oneself from doubtful things', thus Warok can be interpreted as individual with supernatural power who uses their abilities for social good and holds a high status in Panaraga society. \n\n The existence of Warok cannot be separated from the art of reyog—both are like two sides of a coin united in the ethnic identity of Panaraga. The word reyog itself has various debated interpretations, ranging from the onomatopoeic hypothesis of the riyeg-riyeg bamboo sound to Mbah Wo Kucing's philosophical interpretation, which states REYOG as an acronym for five spiritual elements (R: rasa kidung (feeling of song), E: engwang sukma adiluhung (noble soul's essence), Y: Yang Widhi (The Divine), O: olah kridhaning Gusti (the Lord's creative act), G: gelar gumulung kĕrsaning Kang Maha Kuasa (the unfolding of the Almighty's will)), which means that reyog is not merely a performing art but a spiritual medium that connects humans with the divine dimension through artistic expression rich in the philosophical values of the Ponorogo community.\n\nRegardless of various etymological interpretations, the art of reyog was born from a complex socio-political context as a form of criticism by Warok Ki Ageng Kutu Suryaalam against the Majapahit government under the rule of King Brawijaya V, which was considered overly dominated by the queen consort. The phenomenon is symbolized in the form of singa barong or dadak merak—a tiger's head with a peacock's neck—which represents a subtle satire of a leadership that has lost its direction and power. \n\nPanaraga, with its historical and cultural identity, offers a unique depiction of cultural complexity within the mosaic of Javanese culture, featuring Warok as a central figure and reyog as an artistic expression rich in cultural and philosophical meaning. Therefore, this cultural heritage not only becomes a historical asset but also a living identity that must be continuously preserved by future generations as the proud ethnic identity of Panaraga.",

            "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Panaraga is an area that has been etched into the collective memory of Javanese history, with its ancient identity as the region of Wĕngkĕr. This is mentioned in the books Pararaton and Negara Kartagama (D.J Brandes, 1897). Etymologically, the name Wĕngkĕr derives from the phrase wĕngonan angker 'haunted place', which refers to the concept of a place filled with mystical and supernatural aura (Moelyadi, 1986). In the Serat Centhini, canto 213, as translated by Stein Callenfels, there is a narrative that strengthens the historical legacy of Panaraga, which asserts that Wĕngkĕr held an important position in the history of classical Javanese civilization and became the undeniable historical identity of Panaraga.\n\n Geographically, the Panaraga sub-ethnic group refers to the area in the western part of East Java Province, now known as Ponorogo Regency, stretching from the western side of Mount Wilis to eastern side of Mount Lawu. According to Junghuhn's records (1855), numerous altars and terraces resembling worship sites were discovered, which were considered by ancient Javanese society as the dwelling places of gods and sacred crowns. Valentijn (1862) provided a more detailed description that the Panaraga region stretched from Pacitan Bay on the southern coast to Sumbang Village with approximately 150 families, extending two miles east of Mount Lawu, bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south and Lodaya to the east, with the Semangi River in Sangkulang Village serving as an important geographical marker and Mount Wilis as a natural boundary between Panaraga, Nganjuk and Kediri.\n\n In sociocultural context, the Dutch Resident in Madiun, Lucien Adam (1938), provided interesting anthropological notes regarding the characteristics of the Panaraga sub-ethnic community: \n\n The mystery of the origin of the Panaraga people has not been clearly revealed. Although they do not live in isolation from the surrounding areas, their types and characters differ from surrounding districts. People from Panaraga are more independent and self-confident, but also tough, brave, reckless, quick-tempered, and prefer to travel compared to average people in central Java.\n\n Adam's observations reveal the unique temperament of the Panaraga ethnic group, which differs from the general Javanese ethnic group, possessing an independent, brave, and highly adventurous spirit, represented by the figure of Warok as their sociocultural identity. Terminologically, Warok comes from the word waro'i or wirangi, which means 'already understands both physically and spiritually, whose actions are solely to help others', or from the word wewarah (Arabic: wara') which means 'to distance oneself from doubtful things', thus Warok can be interpreted as individual with supernatural power who uses their abilities for social good and holds a high status in Panaraga society. \n\n The existence of Warok cannot be separated from the art of reyog—both are like two sides of a coin united in the ethnic identity of Panaraga. The word reyog itself has various debated interpretations, ranging from the onomatopoeic hypothesis of the riyeg-riyeg bamboo sound to Mbah Wo Kucing's philosophical interpretation, which states REYOG as an acronym for five spiritual elements (R: rasa kidung (feeling of song), E: engwang sukma adiluhung (noble soul's essence), Y: Yang Widhi (The Divine), O: olah kridhaning Gusti (the Lord's creative act), G: gelar gumulung kĕrsaning Kang Maha Kuasa (the unfolding of the Almighty's will)), which means that reyog is not merely a performing art but a spiritual medium that connects humans with the divine dimension through artistic expression rich in the philosophical values of the Ponorogo community.\n\nRegardless of various etymological interpretations, the art of reyog was born from a complex socio-political context as a form of criticism by Warok Ki Ageng Kutu Suryaalam against the Majapahit government under the rule of King Brawijaya V, which was considered overly dominated by the queen consort. The phenomenon is symbolized in the form of singa barong or dadak merak—a tiger's head with a peacock's neck—which represents a subtle satire of a leadership that has lost its direction and power. \n\nPanaraga, with its historical and cultural identity, offers a unique depiction of cultural complexity within the mosaic of Javanese culture, featuring Warok as a central figure and reyog as an artistic expression rich in cultural and philosophical meaning. Therefore, this cultural heritage not only becomes a historical asset but also a living identity that must be continuously preserved by future generations as the proud ethnic identity of Panaraga.",

            "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Panaraga is an area that has been etched into the collective memory of Javanese history, with its ancient identity as the region of Wĕngkĕr. This is mentioned in the books Pararaton and Negara Kartagama (D.J Brandes, 1897). Etymologically, the name Wĕngkĕr derives from the phrase wĕngonan angker 'haunted place', which refers to the concept of a place filled with mystical and supernatural aura (Moelyadi, 1986). In the Serat Centhini, canto 213, as translated by Stein Callenfels, there is a narrative that strengthens the historical legacy of Panaraga, which asserts that Wĕngkĕr held an important position in the history of classical Javanese civilization and became the undeniable historical identity of Panaraga.\n\n Geographically, the Panaraga sub-ethnic group refers to the area in the western part of East Java Province, now known as Ponorogo Regency, stretching from the western side of Mount Wilis to eastern side of Mount Lawu. According to Junghuhn's records (1855), numerous altars and terraces resembling worship sites were discovered, which were considered by ancient Javanese society as the dwelling places of gods and sacred crowns. Valentijn (1862) provided a more detailed description that the Panaraga region stretched from Pacitan Bay on the southern coast to Sumbang Village with approximately 150 families, extending two miles east of Mount Lawu, bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south and Lodaya to the east, with the Semangi River in Sangkulang Village serving as an important geographical marker and Mount Wilis as a natural boundary between Panaraga, Nganjuk and Kediri.\n\n In sociocultural context, the Dutch Resident in Madiun, Lucien Adam (1938), provided interesting anthropological notes regarding the characteristics of the Panaraga sub-ethnic community: \n\n The mystery of the origin of the Panaraga people has not been clearly revealed. Although they do not live in isolation from the surrounding areas, their types and characters differ from surrounding districts. People from Panaraga are more independent and self-confident, but also tough, brave, reckless, quick-tempered, and prefer to travel compared to average people in central Java.\n\n Adam's observations reveal the unique temperament of the Panaraga ethnic group, which differs from the general Javanese ethnic group, possessing an independent, brave, and highly adventurous spirit, represented by the figure of Warok as their sociocultural identity. Terminologically, Warok comes from the word waro'i or wirangi, which means 'already understands both physically and spiritually, whose actions are solely to help others', or from the word wewarah (Arabic: wara') which means 'to distance oneself from doubtful things', thus Warok can be interpreted as individual with supernatural power who uses their abilities for social good and holds a high status in Panaraga society. \n\n The existence of Warok cannot be separated from the art of reyog—both are like two sides of a coin united in the ethnic identity of Panaraga. The word reyog itself has various debated interpretations, ranging from the onomatopoeic hypothesis of the riyeg-riyeg bamboo sound to Mbah Wo Kucing's philosophical interpretation, which states REYOG as an acronym for five spiritual elements (R: rasa kidung (feeling of song), E: engwang sukma adiluhung (noble soul's essence), Y: Yang Widhi (The Divine), O: olah kridhaning Gusti (the Lord's creative act), G: gelar gumulung kĕrsaning Kang Maha Kuasa (the unfolding of the Almighty's will)), which means that reyog is not merely a performing art but a spiritual medium that connects humans with the divine dimension through artistic expression rich in the philosophical values of the Ponorogo community.\n\nRegardless of various etymological interpretations, the art of reyog was born from a complex socio-political context as a form of criticism by Warok Ki Ageng Kutu Suryaalam against the Majapahit government under the rule of King Brawijaya V, which was considered overly dominated by the queen consort. The phenomenon is symbolized in the form of singa barong or dadak merak—a tiger's head with a peacock's neck—which represents a subtle satire of a leadership that has lost its direction and power. \n\nPanaraga, with its historical and cultural identity, offers a unique depiction of cultural complexity within the mosaic of Javanese culture, featuring Warok as a central figure and reyog as an artistic expression rich in cultural and philosophical meaning. Therefore, this cultural heritage not only becomes a historical asset but also a living identity that must be continuously preserved by future generations as the proud ethnic identity of Panaraga.",

In the Serat Centhini, canto 213, as translated by Stein Callenfels, there is a narrative that strengthens the historical legacy of Panaraga, which asserts that Wĕngkĕr held an important position in the history of classical Javanese civilization and became the undeniable historical identity of Panaraga.\n\n Geographically, the Panaraga sub-ethnic group refers to the area in the western part of East Java Province, now known as Ponorogo Regency, stretching from the western side of Mount Wilis to eastern side of Mount Lawu. According to Junghuhn's records (1855), numerous altars and terraces resembling worship sites were discovered, which were considered by ancient Javanese society as the dwelling places of gods and sacred crowns. Valentijn (1862) provided a more detailed description that the Panaraga region stretched from Pacitan Bay on the southern coast to Sumbang Village with approximately 150 families, extending two miles east of Mount Lawu, bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south and Lodaya to the east, with the Semangi River in Sangkulang Village serving as an important geographical marker and Mount Wilis as a natural boundary between Panaraga, Nganjuk and Kediri.\n\n In sociocultural context, the Dutch Resident in Madiun, Lucien Adam (1938), provided interesting anthropological notes regarding the characteristics of the Panaraga sub-ethnic community: \n\n The mystery of the origin of the Panaraga people has not been clearly revealed. Although they do not live in isolation from the surrounding areas, their types and characters differ from surrounding districts. People from Panaraga are more independent and self-confident, but also tough, brave, reckless, quick-tempered, and prefer to travel compared to average people in central Java.\n\n Adam's observations reveal the unique temperament of the Panaraga ethnic group, which differs from the general Javanese ethnic group, possessing an independent, brave, and highly adventurous spirit, represented by the figure of Warok as their sociocultural identity. Terminologically, Warok comes from the word waro'i or wirangi, which means 'already understands both physically and spiritually, whose actions are solely to help others', or from the word wewarah (Arabic: wara') which means 'to distance oneself from doubtful things', thus Warok can be interpreted as individual with supernatural power who uses their abilities for social good and holds a high status in Panaraga society. \n\n The existence of Warok cannot be separated from the art of reyog—both are like two sides of a coin united in the ethnic identity of Panaraga. The word reyog itself has various debated interpretations, ranging from the onomatopoeic hypothesis of the riyeg-riyeg bamboo sound to Mbah Wo Kucing's philosophical interpretation, which states REYOG as an acronym for five spiritual elements (R: rasa kidung (feeling of song), E: engwang sukma adiluhung (noble soul's essence), Y: Yang Widhi (The Divine), O: olah kridhaning Gusti (the Lord's creative act), G: gelar gumulung kĕrsaning Kang Maha Kuasa (the unfolding of the Almighty's will)), which means that reyog is not merely a performing art but a spiritual medium that connects humans with the divine dimension through artistic expression rich in the philosophical values of the Ponorogo community.\n\nRegardless of various etymological interpretations, the art of reyog was born from a complex socio-political context as a form of criticism by Warok Ki Ageng Kutu Suryaalam against the Majapahit government under the rule of King Brawijaya V, which was considered overly dominated by the queen consort. The phenomenon is symbolized in the form of singa barong or dadak merak—a tiger's head with a peacock's neck—which represents a subtle satire of a leadership that has lost its direction and power. \n\nPanaraga, with its historical and cultural identity, offers a unique depiction of cultural complexity within the mosaic of Javanese culture, featuring Warok as a central figure and reyog as an artistic expression rich in cultural and philosophical meaning. Therefore, this cultural heritage not only becomes a historical asset but also a living identity that must be continuously preserved by future generations as the proud ethnic identity of Panaraga.",

            "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Panaraga is an area that has been etched into the collective memory of Javanese history, with its ancient identity as the region of Wĕngkĕr. This is mentioned in the books Pararaton and Negara Kartagama (D.J Brandes, 1897). Etymologically, the name Wĕngkĕr derives from the phrase wĕngonan angker 'haunted place', which refers to the concept of a place filled with mystical and supernatural aura (Moelyadi, 1986). In the Serat Centhini, canto 213, as translated by Stein Callenfels, there is a narrative that strengthens the historical legacy of Panaraga, which asserts that Wĕngkĕr held an important position in the history of classical Javanese civilization and became the undeniable historical identity of Panaraga.\n\n Geographically, the Panaraga sub-ethnic group refers to the area in the western part of East Java Province, now known as Ponorogo Regency, stretching from the western side of Mount Wilis to eastern side of Mount Lawu. According to Junghuhn's records (1855), numerous altars and terraces resembling worship sites were discovered, which were considered by ancient Javanese society as the dwelling places of gods and sacred crowns. Valentijn (1862) provided a more detailed description that the Panaraga region stretched from Pacitan Bay on the southern coast to Sumbang Village with approximately 150 families, extending two miles east of Mount Lawu, bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south and Lodaya to the east, with the Semangi River in Sangkulang Village serving as an important geographical marker and Mount Wilis as a natural boundary between Panaraga, Nganjuk and Kediri.\n\n In sociocultural context, the Dutch Resident in Madiun, Lucien Adam (1938), provided interesting anthropological notes regarding the characteristics of the Panaraga sub-ethnic community: \n\n The mystery of the origin of the Panaraga people has not been clearly revealed. Although they do not live in isolation from the surrounding areas, their types and characters differ from surrounding districts. People from Panaraga are more independent and self-confident, but also tough, brave, reckless, quick-tempered, and prefer to travel compared to average people in central Java.\n\n Adam's observations reveal the unique temperament of the Panaraga ethnic group, which differs from the general Javanese ethnic group, possessing an independent, brave, and highly adventurous spirit, represented by the figure of Warok as their sociocultural identity. Terminologically, Warok comes from the word waro'i or wirangi, which means 'already understands both physically and spiritually, whose actions are solely to help others', or from the word wewarah (Arabic: wara') which means 'to distance oneself from doubtful things', thus Warok can be interpreted as individual with supernatural power who uses their abilities for social good and holds a high status in Panaraga society. \n\n The existence of Warok cannot be separated from the art of reyog—both are like two sides of a coin united in the ethnic identity of Panaraga. The word reyog itself has various debated interpretations, ranging from the onomatopoeic hypothesis of the riyeg-riyeg bamboo sound to Mbah Wo Kucing's philosophical interpretation, which states REYOG as an acronym for five spiritual elements (R: rasa kidung (feeling of song), E: engwang sukma adiluhung (noble soul's essence), Y: Yang Widhi (The Divine), O: olah kridhaning Gusti (the Lord's creative act), G: gelar gumulung kĕrsaning Kang Maha Kuasa (the unfolding of the Almighty's will)), which means that reyog is not merely a performing art but a spiritual medium that connects humans with the divine dimension through artistic expression rich in the philosophical values of the Ponorogo community.\n\nRegardless of various etymological interpretations, the art of reyog was born from a complex socio-political context as a form of criticism by Warok Ki Ageng Kutu Suryaalam against the Majapahit government under the rule of King Brawijaya V, which was considered overly dominated by the queen consort. The phenomenon is symbolized in the form of singa barong or dadak merak—a tiger's head with a peacock's neck—which represents a subtle satire of a leadership that has lost its direction and power. \n\nPanaraga, with its historical and cultural identity, offers a unique depiction of cultural complexity within the mosaic of Javanese culture, featuring Warok as a central figure and reyog as an artistic expression rich in cultural and philosophical meaning. Therefore, this cultural heritage not only becomes a historical asset but also a living identity that must be continuously preserved by future generations as the proud ethnic identity of Panaraga.",

            "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Panaraga is an area that has been etched into the collective memory of Javanese history, with its ancient identity as the region of Wĕngkĕr. This is mentioned in the books Pararaton and Negara Kartagama (D.J Brandes, 1897). Etymologically, the name Wĕngkĕr derives from the phrase wĕngonan angker 'haunted place', which refers to the concept of a place filled with mystical and supernatural aura (Moelyadi, 1986). In the Serat Centhini, canto 213, as translated by Stein Callenfels, there is a narrative that strengthens the historical legacy of Panaraga, which asserts that Wĕngkĕr held an important position in the history of classical Javanese civilization and became the undeniable historical identity of Panaraga.\n\n Geographically, the Panaraga sub-ethnic group refers to the area in the western part of East Java Province, now known as Ponorogo Regency, stretching from the western side of Mount Wilis to eastern side of Mount Lawu. According to Junghuhn's records (1855), numerous altars and terraces resembling worship sites were discovered, which were considered by ancient Javanese society as the dwelling places of gods and sacred crowns. Valentijn (1862) provided a more detailed description that the Panaraga region stretched from Pacitan Bay on the southern coast to Sumbang Village with approximately 150 families, extending two miles east of Mount Lawu, bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south and Lodaya to the east, with the Semangi River in Sangkulang Village serving as an important geographical marker and Mount Wilis as a natural boundary between Panaraga, Nganjuk and Kediri.\n\n In sociocultural context, the Dutch Resident in Madiun, Lucien Adam (1938), provided interesting anthropological notes regarding the characteristics of the Panaraga sub-ethnic community: \n\n The mystery of the origin of the Panaraga people has not been clearly revealed. Although they do not live in isolation from the surrounding areas, their types and characters differ from surrounding districts. People from Panaraga are more independent and self-confident, but also tough, brave, reckless, quick-tempered, and prefer to travel compared to average people in central Java.\n\n Adam's observations reveal the unique temperament of the Panaraga ethnic group, which differs from the general Javanese ethnic group, possessing an independent, brave, and highly adventurous spirit, represented by the figure of Warok as their sociocultural identity. Terminologically, Warok comes from the word waro'i or wirangi, which means 'already understands both physically and spiritually, whose actions are solely to help others', or from the word wewarah (Arabic: wara') which means 'to distance oneself from doubtful things', thus Warok can be interpreted as individual with supernatural power who uses their abilities for social good and holds a high status in Panaraga society. \n\n The existence of Warok cannot be separated from the art of reyog—both are like two sides of a coin united in the ethnic identity of Panaraga. The word reyog itself has various debated interpretations, ranging from the onomatopoeic hypothesis of the riyeg-riyeg bamboo sound to Mbah Wo Kucing's philosophical interpretation, which states REYOG as an acronym for five spiritual elements (R: rasa kidung (feeling of song), E: engwang sukma adiluhung (noble soul's essence), Y: Yang Widhi (The Divine), O: olah kridhaning Gusti (the Lord's creative act), G: gelar gumulung kĕrsaning Kang Maha Kuasa (the unfolding of the Almighty's will)), which means that reyog is not merely a performing art but a spiritual medium that connects humans with the divine dimension through artistic expression rich in the philosophical values of the Ponorogo community.\n\nRegardless of various etymological interpretations, the art of reyog was born from a complex socio-political context as a form of criticism by Warok Ki Ageng Kutu Suryaalam against the Majapahit government under the rule of King Brawijaya V, which was considered overly dominated by the queen consort. The phenomenon is symbolized in the form of singa barong or dadak merak—a tiger's head with a peacock's neck—which represents a subtle satire of a leadership that has lost its direction and power. \n\nPanaraga, with its historical and cultural identity, offers a unique depiction of cultural complexity within the mosaic of Javanese culture, featuring Warok as a central figure and reyog as an artistic expression rich in cultural and philosophical meaning. Therefore, this cultural heritage not only becomes a historical asset but also a living identity that must be continuously preserved by future generations as the proud ethnic identity of Panaraga.",

According to Junghuhn's records (1855), numerous altars and terraces resembling worship sites were discovered, which were considered by ancient Javanese society as the dwelling places of gods and sacred crowns. Valentijn (1862) provided a more detailed description that the Panaraga region stretched from Pacitan Bay on the southern coast to Sumbang Village with approximately 150 families, extending two miles east of Mount Lawu, bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south and Lodaya to the east, with the Semangi River in Sangkulang Village serving as an important geographical marker and Mount Wilis as a natural boundary between Panaraga, Nganjuk and Kediri.\n\n In sociocultural context, the Dutch Resident in Madiun, Lucien Adam (1938), provided interesting anthropological notes regarding the characteristics of the Panaraga sub-ethnic community: \n\n The mystery of the origin of the Panaraga people has not been clearly revealed. Although they do not live in isolation from the surrounding areas, their types and characters differ from surrounding districts. People from Panaraga are more independent and self-confident, but also tough, brave, reckless, quick-tempered, and prefer to travel compared to average people in central Java.\n\n Adam's observations reveal the unique temperament of the Panaraga ethnic group, which differs from the general Javanese ethnic group, possessing an independent, brave, and highly adventurous spirit, represented by the figure of Warok as their sociocultural identity. Terminologically, Warok comes from the word waro'i or wirangi, which means 'already understands both physically and spiritually, whose actions are solely to help others', or from the word wewarah (Arabic: wara') which means 'to distance oneself from doubtful things', thus Warok can be interpreted as individual with supernatural power who uses their abilities for social good and holds a high status in Panaraga society. \n\n The existence of Warok cannot be separated from the art of reyog—both are like two sides of a coin united in the ethnic identity of Panaraga. The word reyog itself has various debated interpretations, ranging from the onomatopoeic hypothesis of the riyeg-riyeg bamboo sound to Mbah Wo Kucing's philosophical interpretation, which states REYOG as an acronym for five spiritual elements (R: rasa kidung (feeling of song), E: engwang sukma adiluhung (noble soul's essence), Y: Yang Widhi (The Divine), O: olah kridhaning Gusti (the Lord's creative act), G: gelar gumulung kĕrsaning Kang Maha Kuasa (the unfolding of the Almighty's will)), which means that reyog is not merely a performing art but a spiritual medium that connects humans with the divine dimension through artistic expression rich in the philosophical values of the Ponorogo community.\n\nRegardless of various etymological interpretations, the art of reyog was born from a complex socio-political context as a form of criticism by Warok Ki Ageng Kutu Suryaalam against the Majapahit government under the rule of King Brawijaya V, which was considered overly dominated by the queen consort. The phenomenon is symbolized in the form of singa barong or dadak merak—a tiger's head with a peacock's neck—which represents a subtle satire of a leadership that has lost its direction and power. \n\nPanaraga, with its historical and cultural identity, offers a unique depiction of cultural complexity within the mosaic of Javanese culture, featuring Warok as a central figure and reyog as an artistic expression rich in cultural and philosophical meaning. Therefore, this cultural heritage not only becomes a historical asset but also a living identity that must be continuously preserved by future generations as the proud ethnic identity of Panaraga.",

            "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Panaraga is an area that has been etched into the collective memory of Javanese history, with its ancient identity as the region of Wĕngkĕr. This is mentioned in the books Pararaton and Negara Kartagama (D.J Brandes, 1897). Etymologically, the name Wĕngkĕr derives from the phrase wĕngonan angker 'haunted place', which refers to the concept of a place filled with mystical and supernatural aura (Moelyadi, 1986). In the Serat Centhini, canto 213, as translated by Stein Callenfels, there is a narrative that strengthens the historical legacy of Panaraga, which asserts that Wĕngkĕr held an important position in the history of classical Javanese civilization and became the undeniable historical identity of Panaraga.\n\n Geographically, the Panaraga sub-ethnic group refers to the area in the western part of East Java Province, now known as Ponorogo Regency, stretching from the western side of Mount Wilis to eastern side of Mount Lawu. According to Junghuhn's records (1855), numerous altars and terraces resembling worship sites were discovered, which were considered by ancient Javanese society as the dwelling places of gods and sacred crowns. Valentijn (1862) provided a more detailed description that the Panaraga region stretched from Pacitan Bay on the southern coast to Sumbang Village with approximately 150 families, extending two miles east of Mount Lawu, bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south and Lodaya to the east, with the Semangi River in Sangkulang Village serving as an important geographical marker and Mount Wilis as a natural boundary between Panaraga, Nganjuk and Kediri.\n\n In sociocultural context, the Dutch Resident in Madiun, Lucien Adam (1938), provided interesting anthropological notes regarding the characteristics of the Panaraga sub-ethnic community: \n\n The mystery of the origin of the Panaraga people has not been clearly revealed. Although they do not live in isolation from the surrounding areas, their types and characters differ from surrounding districts. People from Panaraga are more independent and self-confident, but also tough, brave, reckless, quick-tempered, and prefer to travel compared to average people in central Java.\n\n Adam's observations reveal the unique temperament of the Panaraga ethnic group, which differs from the general Javanese ethnic group, possessing an independent, brave, and highly adventurous spirit, represented by the figure of Warok as their sociocultural identity. Terminologically, Warok comes from the word waro'i or wirangi, which means 'already understands both physically and spiritually, whose actions are solely to help others', or from the word wewarah (Arabic: wara') which means 'to distance oneself from doubtful things', thus Warok can be interpreted as individual with supernatural power who uses their abilities for social good and holds a high status in Panaraga society. \n\n The existence of Warok cannot be separated from the art of reyog—both are like two sides of a coin united in the ethnic identity of Panaraga. The word reyog itself has various debated interpretations, ranging from the onomatopoeic hypothesis of the riyeg-riyeg bamboo sound to Mbah Wo Kucing's philosophical interpretation, which states REYOG as an acronym for five spiritual elements (R: rasa kidung (feeling of song), E: engwang sukma adiluhung (noble soul's essence), Y: Yang Widhi (The Divine), O: olah kridhaning Gusti (the Lord's creative act), G: gelar gumulung kĕrsaning Kang Maha Kuasa (the unfolding of the Almighty's will)), which means that reyog is not merely a performing art but a spiritual medium that connects humans with the divine dimension through artistic expression rich in the philosophical values of the Ponorogo community.\n\nRegardless of various etymological interpretations, the art of reyog was born from a complex socio-political context as a form of criticism by Warok Ki Ageng Kutu Suryaalam against the Majapahit government under the rule of King Brawijaya V, which was considered overly dominated by the queen consort. The phenomenon is symbolized in the form of singa barong or dadak merak—a tiger's head with a peacock's neck—which represents a subtle satire of a leadership that has lost its direction and power. \n\nPanaraga, with its historical and cultural identity, offers a unique depiction of cultural complexity within the mosaic of Javanese culture, featuring Warok as a central figure and reyog as an artistic expression rich in cultural and philosophical meaning. Therefore, this cultural heritage not only becomes a historical asset but also a living identity that must be continuously preserved by future generations as the proud ethnic identity of Panaraga.",

            "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Panaraga is an area that has been etched into the collective memory of Javanese history, with its ancient identity as the region of Wĕngkĕr. This is mentioned in the books Pararaton and Negara Kartagama (D.J Brandes, 1897). Etymologically, the name Wĕngkĕr derives from the phrase wĕngonan angker 'haunted place', which refers to the concept of a place filled with mystical and supernatural aura (Moelyadi, 1986). In the Serat Centhini, canto 213, as translated by Stein Callenfels, there is a narrative that strengthens the historical legacy of Panaraga, which asserts that Wĕngkĕr held an important position in the history of classical Javanese civilization and became the undeniable historical identity of Panaraga.\n\n Geographically, the Panaraga sub-ethnic group refers to the area in the western part of East Java Province, now known as Ponorogo Regency, stretching from the western side of Mount Wilis to eastern side of Mount Lawu. According to Junghuhn's records (1855), numerous altars and terraces resembling worship sites were discovered, which were considered by ancient Javanese society as the dwelling places of gods and sacred crowns. Valentijn (1862) provided a more detailed description that the Panaraga region stretched from Pacitan Bay on the southern coast to Sumbang Village with approximately 150 families, extending two miles east of Mount Lawu, bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south and Lodaya to the east, with the Semangi River in Sangkulang Village serving as an important geographical marker and Mount Wilis as a natural boundary between Panaraga, Nganjuk and Kediri.\n\n In sociocultural context, the Dutch Resident in Madiun, Lucien Adam (1938), provided interesting anthropological notes regarding the characteristics of the Panaraga sub-ethnic community: \n\n The mystery of the origin of the Panaraga people has not been clearly revealed. Although they do not live in isolation from the surrounding areas, their types and characters differ from surrounding districts. People from Panaraga are more independent and self-confident, but also tough, brave, reckless, quick-tempered, and prefer to travel compared to average people in central Java.\n\n Adam's observations reveal the unique temperament of the Panaraga ethnic group, which differs from the general Javanese ethnic group, possessing an independent, brave, and highly adventurous spirit, represented by the figure of Warok as their sociocultural identity. Terminologically, Warok comes from the word waro'i or wirangi, which means 'already understands both physically and spiritually, whose actions are solely to help others', or from the word wewarah (Arabic: wara') which means 'to distance oneself from doubtful things', thus Warok can be interpreted as individual with supernatural power who uses their abilities for social good and holds a high status in Panaraga society. \n\n The existence of Warok cannot be separated from the art of reyog—both are like two sides of a coin united in the ethnic identity of Panaraga. The word reyog itself has various debated interpretations, ranging from the onomatopoeic hypothesis of the riyeg-riyeg bamboo sound to Mbah Wo Kucing's philosophical interpretation, which states REYOG as an acronym for five spiritual elements (R: rasa kidung (feeling of song), E: engwang sukma adiluhung (noble soul's essence), Y: Yang Widhi (The Divine), O: olah kridhaning Gusti (the Lord's creative act), G: gelar gumulung kĕrsaning Kang Maha Kuasa (the unfolding of the Almighty's will)), which means that reyog is not merely a performing art but a spiritual medium that connects humans with the divine dimension through artistic expression rich in the philosophical values of the Ponorogo community.\n\nRegardless of various etymological interpretations, the art of reyog was born from a complex socio-political context as a form of criticism by Warok Ki Ageng Kutu Suryaalam against the Majapahit government under the rule of King Brawijaya V, which was considered overly dominated by the queen consort. The phenomenon is symbolized in the form of singa barong or dadak merak—a tiger's head with a peacock's neck—which represents a subtle satire of a leadership that has lost its direction and power. \n\nPanaraga, with its historical and cultural identity, offers a unique depiction of cultural complexity within the mosaic of Javanese culture, featuring Warok as a central figure and reyog as an artistic expression rich in cultural and philosophical meaning. Therefore, this cultural heritage not only becomes a historical asset but also a living identity that must be continuously preserved by future generations as the proud ethnic identity of Panaraga.",

            "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Panaraga is an area that has been etched into the collective memory of Javanese history, with its ancient identity as the region of Wĕngkĕr. This is mentioned in the books Pararaton and Negara Kartagama (D.J Brandes, 1897). Etymologically, the name Wĕngkĕr derives from the phrase wĕngonan angker 'haunted place', which refers to the concept of a place filled with mystical and supernatural aura (Moelyadi, 1986). In the Serat Centhini, canto 213, as translated by Stein Callenfels, there is a narrative that strengthens the historical legacy of Panaraga, which asserts that Wĕngkĕr held an important position in the history of classical Javanese civilization and became the undeniable historical identity of Panaraga.\n\n Geographically, the Panaraga sub-ethnic group refers to the area in the western part of East Java Province, now known as Ponorogo Regency, stretching from the western side of Mount Wilis to eastern side of Mount Lawu. According to Junghuhn's records (1855), numerous altars and terraces resembling worship sites were discovered, which were considered by ancient Javanese society as the dwelling places of gods and sacred crowns. Valentijn (1862) provided a more detailed description that the Panaraga region stretched from Pacitan Bay on the southern coast to Sumbang Village with approximately 150 families, extending two miles east of Mount Lawu, bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south and Lodaya to the east, with the Semangi River in Sangkulang Village serving as an important geographical marker and Mount Wilis as a natural boundary between Panaraga, Nganjuk and Kediri.\n\n In sociocultural context, the Dutch Resident in Madiun, Lucien Adam (1938), provided interesting anthropological notes regarding the characteristics of the Panaraga sub-ethnic community: \n\n The mystery of the origin of the Panaraga people has not been clearly revealed. Although they do not live in isolation from the surrounding areas, their types and characters differ from surrounding districts. People from Panaraga are more independent and self-confident, but also tough, brave, reckless, quick-tempered, and prefer to travel compared to average people in central Java.\n\n Adam's observations reveal the unique temperament of the Panaraga ethnic group, which differs from the general Javanese ethnic group, possessing an independent, brave, and highly adventurous spirit, represented by the figure of Warok as their sociocultural identity. Terminologically, Warok comes from the word waro'i or wirangi, which means 'already understands both physically and spiritually, whose actions are solely to help others', or from the word wewarah (Arabic: wara') which means 'to distance oneself from doubtful things', thus Warok can be interpreted as individual with supernatural power who uses their abilities for social good and holds a high status in Panaraga society. \n\n The existence of Warok cannot be separated from the art of reyog—both are like two sides of a coin united in the ethnic identity of Panaraga. The word reyog itself has various debated interpretations, ranging from the onomatopoeic hypothesis of the riyeg-riyeg bamboo sound to Mbah Wo Kucing's philosophical interpretation, which states REYOG as an acronym for five spiritual elements (R: rasa kidung (feeling of song), E: engwang sukma adiluhung (noble soul's essence), Y: Yang Widhi (The Divine), O: olah kridhaning Gusti (the Lord's creative act), G: gelar gumulung kĕrsaning Kang Maha Kuasa (the unfolding of the Almighty's will)), which means that reyog is not merely a performing art but a spiritual medium that connects humans with the divine dimension through artistic expression rich in the philosophical values of the Ponorogo community.\n\nRegardless of various etymological interpretations, the art of reyog was born from a complex socio-political context as a form of criticism by Warok Ki Ageng Kutu Suryaalam against the Majapahit government under the rule of King Brawijaya V, which was considered overly dominated by the queen consort. The phenomenon is symbolized in the form of singa barong or dadak merak—a tiger's head with a peacock's neck—which represents a subtle satire of a leadership that has lost its direction and power. \n\nPanaraga, with its historical and cultural identity, offers a unique depiction of cultural complexity within the mosaic of Javanese culture, featuring Warok as a central figure and reyog as an artistic expression rich in cultural and philosophical meaning. Therefore, this cultural heritage not only becomes a historical asset but also a living identity that must be continuously preserved by future generations as the proud ethnic identity of Panaraga.",

            "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Tengger in Old Javanese means “highlands” (Gericke and Roorda, 1901:918), and thus the meaning of Wong Tengger would have mean persons who lived in highlands. In nowadays Java, Tengger no longer refer to that, but cover to “perch and sit above” (Hefner, 1985:25). Wong Tengger ‘Tengger People’ are indigenous community who resides and surrounds around the slope of Mountain Brahma (Bromo). The Tengger highlands locates to the northeast from Malang. There are three gates to reach there: (1) the first route is going to the north from Malang to Pasuruan or Purwodadi, we will find the main entrance Wonokitri village in Tosari district and going up to the Ngadiwono village. These regions well known as western side (brang kulon) of Tengger highlands; (2) the second route is heading to Probolinggo, we will reach the main entrance is Cemoro Lawang village (Ngadisari district) and directly overlooks mount Bromo and Tengger caldera. These gates are popularly known as eastern side (brang wetan) of Tengger highlands; (3) the third access has two kinds of gates: (1) heading to Tumpang, Malang then we will reach the Gubugklakah, and the main gate is Ngadas village; (2) heading to Lumajang, and climbing to Senduro, Ranupani. These regions are known as southern (brang kidul) of Tengger highlands.\n\nHong hulun Basuki Langgeng\n\nHong Hulun Basuki Langgeng is Tenggerese salutation. This formula consists of four words in Old Javenese: Oṅ or Om is often referred to mantra or formula praise; ṅhulun is the usual pronoun for the first person (Zoetmulder:1982). Whilst the rest of the words are still existed in modern Javanese, basuki means well-being, and laṅgĕṅ holds the meaning permanent. So, the Tenggerese salutation can be interpreted in the following: “Om, (Brahmā, Visnū, Sivā), I wish for eternal well-being”. Then, the receiver will reply: basuki laṅgĕṅ ‘well-being forever’. This salutation is given when someone visit their relatives by knocking the door or for maintaining social relationship among Tenggerese when they meet each other in market or climbing up to the Bromo.\n\nDukun Panḍita as divine actors \n\nIn order to maintain the divine relationship between the people of Tengger and their deities and ancestor, the role of dukun panḍita (priest of Tengger) is central (Sukmawan, 2022:14). In the rituals that they perform, the priest is acting like the middleman who mediate the realm world to divine world. By uttering their formulas (mantra) and mentioning the means of the ritual, the priest communicates to the unseen figures to the man who dedicated their offerings to their deities or ancestors. In all the rituals that are performed by Tenggerese, the priest is the main actor. Tenggerese often call the name of the dukun as Rama. Every Tengger villages has dukun and the assistant of the dukun. dukun as Rama. Every Tengger villages has dukun and the assistant of the dukun.",

People from Panaraga are more independent and self-confident, but also tough, brave, reckless, quick-tempered, and prefer to travel compared to average people in central Java.\n\n Adam's observations reveal the unique temperament of the Panaraga ethnic group, which differs from the general Javanese ethnic group, possessing an independent, brave, and highly adventurous spirit, represented by the figure of Warok as their sociocultural identity. Terminologically, Warok comes from the word waro'i or wirangi, which means 'already understands both physically and spiritually, whose actions are solely to help others', or from the word wewarah (Arabic: wara') which means 'to distance oneself from doubtful things', thus Warok can be interpreted as individual with supernatural power who uses their abilities for social good and holds a high status in Panaraga society. \n\n The existence of Warok cannot be separated from the art of reyog—both are like two sides of a coin united in the ethnic identity of Panaraga. The word reyog itself has various debated interpretations, ranging from the onomatopoeic hypothesis of the riyeg-riyeg bamboo sound to Mbah Wo Kucing's philosophical interpretation, which states REYOG as an acronym for five spiritual elements (R: rasa kidung (feeling of song), E: engwang sukma adiluhung (noble soul's essence), Y: Yang Widhi (The Divine), O: olah kridhaning Gusti (the Lord's creative act), G: gelar gumulung kĕrsaning Kang Maha Kuasa (the unfolding of the Almighty's will)), which means that reyog is not merely a performing art but a spiritual medium that connects humans with the divine dimension through artistic expression rich in the philosophical values of the Ponorogo community.\n\nRegardless of various etymological interpretations, the art of reyog was born from a complex socio-political context as a form of criticism by Warok Ki Ageng Kutu Suryaalam against the Majapahit government under the rule of King Brawijaya V, which was considered overly dominated by the queen consort. The phenomenon is symbolized in the form of singa barong or dadak merak—a tiger's head with a peacock's neck—which represents a subtle satire of a leadership that has lost its direction and power. \n\nPanaraga, with its historical and cultural identity, offers a unique depiction of cultural complexity within the mosaic of Javanese culture, featuring Warok as a central figure and reyog as an artistic expression rich in cultural and philosophical meaning. Therefore, this cultural heritage not only becomes a historical asset but also a living identity that must be continuously preserved by future generations as the proud ethnic identity of Panaraga.",

Etymologically, the name Wĕngkĕr derives from the phrase wĕngonan angker 'haunted place', which refers to the concept of a place filled with mystical and supernatural aura (Moelyadi, 1986).

            "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Panaraga is an area that has been etched into the collective memory of Javanese history, with its ancient identity as the region of Wĕngkĕr. This is mentioned in the books Pararaton and Negara Kartagama (D.J Brandes, 1897). Etymologically, the name Wĕngkĕr derives from the phrase wĕngonan angker 'haunted place', which refers to the concept of a place filled with mystical and supernatural aura (Moelyadi, 1986). In the Serat Centhini, canto 213, as translated by Stein Callenfels, there is a narrative that strengthens the historical legacy of Panaraga, which asserts that Wĕngkĕr held an important position in the history of classical Javanese civilization and became the undeniable historical identity of Panaraga.\n\n Geographically, the Panaraga sub-ethnic group refers to the area in the western part of East Java Province, now known as Ponorogo Regency, stretching from the western side of Mount Wilis to eastern side of Mount Lawu. According to Junghuhn's records (1855), numerous altars and terraces resembling worship sites were discovered, which were considered by ancient Javanese society as the dwelling places of gods and sacred crowns. Valentijn (1862) provided a more detailed description that the Panaraga region stretched from Pacitan Bay on the southern coast to Sumbang Village with approximately 150 families, extending two miles east of Mount Lawu, bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south and Lodaya to the east, with the Semangi River in Sangkulang Village serving as an important geographical marker and Mount Wilis as a natural boundary between Panaraga, Nganjuk and Kediri.\n\n In sociocultural context, the Dutch Resident in Madiun, Lucien Adam (1938), provided interesting anthropological notes regarding the characteristics of the Panaraga sub-ethnic community: \n\n The mystery of the origin of the Panaraga people has not been clearly revealed. Although they do not live in isolation from the surrounding areas, their types and characters differ from surrounding districts. People from Panaraga are more independent and self-confident, but also tough, brave, reckless, quick-tempered, and prefer to travel compared to average people in central Java.\n\n Adam's observations reveal the unique temperament of the Panaraga ethnic group, which differs from the general Javanese ethnic group, possessing an independent, brave, and highly adventurous spirit, represented by the figure of Warok as their sociocultural identity.

Senggakan dalam kesenian Reog ibarat sebuah makanan tanpa kerupuk maka tidak akan terasa kriuk tanpa senggakan.

Wiraswara ini mengandung kearifan lokal gotong-royong, kerja sama, dan kekompakan dalam hidup dan kehidupan untuk menghasilkan harmoni sosial dalam masyarakat sebagaimana wiras wara yang menghasilkan suara yang merdu nan mengandung motivasi kepada siapa pun yang mendengarkan sehingga merasa penonton maupun pemain merasa sangat terhibur",

            "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Panaraga is an area that has been etched into the collective memory of Javanese history, with its ancient identity as the region of Wĕngkĕr. This is mentioned in the books Pararaton and Negara Kartagama (D.J Brandes, 1897). Etymologically, the name Wĕngkĕr derives from the phrase wĕngonan angker 'haunted place', which refers to the concept of a place filled with mystical and supernatural aura (Moelyadi, 1986). In the Serat Centhini, canto 213, as translated by Stein Callenfels, there is a narrative that strengthens the historical legacy of Panaraga, which asserts that Wĕngkĕr held an important position in the history of classical Javanese civilization and became the undeniable historical identity of Panaraga.\n\n Geographically, the Panaraga sub-ethnic group refers to the area in the western part of East Java Province, now known as Ponorogo Regency, stretching from the western side of Mount Wilis to eastern side of Mount Lawu. According to Junghuhn's records (1855), numerous altars and terraces resembling worship sites were discovered, which were considered by ancient Javanese society as the dwelling places of gods and sacred crowns. Valentijn (1862) provided a more detailed description that the Panaraga region stretched from Pacitan Bay on the southern coast to Sumbang Village with approximately 150 families, extending two miles east of Mount Lawu, bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south and Lodaya to the east, with the Semangi River in Sangkulang Village serving as an important geographical marker and Mount Wilis as a natural boundary between Panaraga, Nganjuk and Kediri.\n\n In sociocultural context, the Dutch Resident in Madiun, Lucien Adam (1938), provided interesting anthropological notes regarding the characteristics of the Panaraga sub-ethnic community: \n\n The mystery of the origin of the Panaraga people has not been clearly revealed. Although they do not live in isolation from the surrounding areas, their types and characters differ from surrounding districts. People from Panaraga are more independent and self-confident, but also tough, brave, reckless, quick-tempered, and prefer to travel compared to average people in central Java.\n\n Adam's observations reveal the unique temperament of the Panaraga ethnic group, which differs from the general Javanese ethnic group, possessing an independent, brave, and highly adventurous spirit, represented by the figure of Warok as their sociocultural identity. Terminologically, Warok comes from the word waro'i or wirangi, which means 'already understands both physically and spiritually, whose actions are solely to help others', or from the word wewarah (Arabic: wara') which means 'to distance oneself from doubtful things', thus Warok can be interpreted as individual with supernatural power who uses their abilities for social good and holds a high status in Panaraga society. \n\n The existence of Warok cannot be separated from the art of reyog—both are like two sides of a coin united in the ethnic identity of Panaraga. The word reyog itself has various debated interpretations, ranging from the onomatopoeic hypothesis of the riyeg-riyeg bamboo sound to Mbah Wo Kucing's philosophical interpretation, which states REYOG as an acronym for five spiritual elements (R: rasa kidung (feeling of song), E: engwang sukma adiluhung (noble soul's essence), Y: Yang Widhi (The Divine), O: olah kridhaning Gusti (the Lord's creative act), G: gelar gumulung kĕrsaning Kang Maha Kuasa (the unfolding of the Almighty's will)), which means that reyog is not merely a performing art but a spiritual medium that connects humans with the divine dimension through artistic expression rich in the philosophical values of the Ponorogo community.\n\nRegardless of various etymological interpretations, the art of reyog was born from a complex socio-political context as a form of criticism by Warok Ki Ageng Kutu Suryaalam against the Majapahit government under the rule of King Brawijaya V, which was considered overly dominated by the queen consort. The phenomenon is symbolized in the form of singa barong or dadak merak—a tiger's head with a peacock's neck—which represents a subtle satire of a leadership that has lost its direction and power. \n\nPanaraga, with its historical and cultural identity, offers a unique depiction of cultural complexity within the mosaic of Javanese culture, featuring Warok as a central figure and reyog as an artistic expression rich in cultural and philosophical meaning. Therefore, this cultural heritage not only becomes a historical asset but also a living identity that must be continuously preserved by future generations as the proud ethnic identity of Panaraga.",

            "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Panaraga is an area that has been etched into the collective memory of Javanese history, with its ancient identity as the region of Wĕngkĕr. This is mentioned in the books Pararaton and Negara Kartagama (D.J Brandes, 1897). Etymologically, the name Wĕngkĕr derives from the phrase wĕngonan angker 'haunted place', which refers to the concept of a place filled with mystical and supernatural aura (Moelyadi, 1986). In the Serat Centhini, canto 213, as translated by Stein Callenfels, there is a narrative that strengthens the historical legacy of Panaraga, which asserts that Wĕngkĕr held an important position in the history of classical Javanese civilization and became the undeniable historical identity of Panaraga.\n\n Geographically, the Panaraga sub-ethnic group refers to the area in the western part of East Java Province, now known as Ponorogo Regency, stretching from the western side of Mount Wilis to eastern side of Mount Lawu. According to Junghuhn's records (1855), numerous altars and terraces resembling worship sites were discovered, which were considered by ancient Javanese society as the dwelling places of gods and sacred crowns. Valentijn (1862) provided a more detailed description that the Panaraga region stretched from Pacitan Bay on the southern coast to Sumbang Village with approximately 150 families, extending two miles east of Mount Lawu, bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south and Lodaya to the east, with the Semangi River in Sangkulang Village serving as an important geographical marker and Mount Wilis as a natural boundary between Panaraga, Nganjuk and Kediri.\n\n In sociocultural context, the Dutch Resident in Madiun, Lucien Adam (1938), provided interesting anthropological notes regarding the characteristics of the Panaraga sub-ethnic community: \n\n The mystery of the origin of the Panaraga people has not been clearly revealed. Although they do not live in isolation from the surrounding areas, their types and characters differ from surrounding districts. People from Panaraga are more independent and self-confident, but also tough, brave, reckless, quick-tempered, and prefer to travel compared to average people in central Java.\n\n Adam's observations reveal the unique temperament of the Panaraga ethnic group, which differs from the general Javanese ethnic group, possessing an independent, brave, and highly adventurous spirit, represented by the figure of Warok as their sociocultural identity. Terminologically, Warok comes from the word waro'i or wirangi, which means 'already understands both physically and spiritually, whose actions are solely to help others', or from the word wewarah (Arabic: wara') which means 'to distance oneself from doubtful things', thus Warok can be interpreted as individual with supernatural power who uses their abilities for social good and holds a high status in Panaraga society. \n\n The existence of Warok cannot be separated from the art of reyog—both are like two sides of a coin united in the ethnic identity of Panaraga. The word reyog itself has various debated interpretations, ranging from the onomatopoeic hypothesis of the riyeg-riyeg bamboo sound to Mbah Wo Kucing's philosophical interpretation, which states REYOG as an acronym for five spiritual elements (R: rasa kidung (feeling of song), E: engwang sukma adiluhung (noble soul's essence), Y: Yang Widhi (The Divine), O: olah kridhaning Gusti (the Lord's creative act), G: gelar gumulung kĕrsaning Kang Maha Kuasa (the unfolding of the Almighty's will)), which means that reyog is not merely a performing art but a spiritual medium that connects humans with the divine dimension through artistic expression rich in the philosophical values of the Ponorogo community.\n\nRegardless of various etymological interpretations, the art of reyog was born from a complex socio-political context as a form of criticism by Warok Ki Ageng Kutu Suryaalam against the Majapahit government under the rule of King Brawijaya V, which was considered overly dominated by the queen consort. The phenomenon is symbolized in the form of singa barong or dadak merak—a tiger's head with a peacock's neck—which represents a subtle satire of a leadership that has lost its direction and power. \n\nPanaraga, with its historical and cultural identity, offers a unique depiction of cultural complexity within the mosaic of Javanese culture, featuring Warok as a central figure and reyog as an artistic expression rich in cultural and philosophical meaning. Therefore, this cultural heritage not only becomes a historical asset but also a living identity that must be continuously preserved by future generations as the proud ethnic identity of Panaraga.",

            "culturalMeaning": "Its precise etymology unclear, the barikan is identified by modern Tengger as a rite of balikan or the \"turning back\" of evil from the village. In some communities barikan occurs every thirty-five days, but in others it takes place only after eclipses, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions. The liturgy is celebrated at the village chief's house. Women bring baskets of cooked food to the front steps of the house. While village officials act as \"witnesses,\" the priest blesses the food and returns half to the women. The half which remains is used to make a communion meal for the priest and village officials. The half taken home is eaten by members of each household, who thereby share in its blessing. A small portion of the home food is in addition made into tamping earth offerings, set out by each family around the house and fields. (Hefner, 1985: 123). \"Slametan Barian yang dilaksanakan setiap bulan sekali pada hari Jumat pasaran Legi dilaksanakan dalam rangka meminta perlindungan dan keselamatan kosmis.\" (Sukmawan, 2018:88). Upacara ini dilakukan kalau terjadi gerhana, gempa dan peristiwaperistiwa alam lainnya yang ada hubungan erat dengan kehidupan manusia. Terjadinya peristiwa-peristiwa alam akan mempengaruhi kehidupan manusia tergantung dari waktu terjadinya jam berapa, hari apa, bulan dan tahun apa. (Proyek Sasana Budaya Jakarta, 1978). Ritual untuk keselamatan dan dapat menolak bahaya (tolak sengkala) yang bakal datang, tetapi juga diadakan sebagai tanda terima kasih kepada Hyang Maha Agung (Sutarto, 2006: 10).

Berlandaskan keyakinan akan relasi manusia dengan alam, leluhur, dan kekuatan adikodrati, ritus ini berfungsi memulihkan harmoni yang terganggu. Barikan dilaksanakan di rumah pemimpin adat dan dipimpin dukun, dengan sajian makanan yang dibagi dua: sebagian disantap dalam kebersamaan ritual, sisanya dibawa pulang sebagai sesaji di pekarangan dan ladang. Selain sebagai proteksi spiritual, barikan juga dimaknai sebagai ungkapan syukur dan perekat solidaritas sosial.\n",
            "translation": "Barikan is a rite of the Tengger community for collective protection against threats, supernatural threats, natural phenomena, or cosmic disturbances. Grounded in the belief in the relationship between humans, nature, ancestors, and supernatural forces, the rite serves to restore disrupted harmony. Barikan is held at customary leader's residence and led by the village dukun (shaman). The food offerings in this rite are split to two: one portion to be consumed together during the ritual gathering, and another taken home as offerings in yards and fields. Beyond spiritual protection, barikan is also understood as an expression of gratitude and social solidarity strengthening.",

Penggunaannya meluas dari ritus sakral yang terikat penanggalan adat menjadi praktik yang lebih fleksibel, misalnya pada awal musim tanam atau pembukaan fasilitas umum.

            "variantTranslations": "The term barikan carries multiple meanings, often intertwined with selamatan (celebration), ruwatan (purification), kenduren (feast), or tolak bala (warding off misfortune), depending on the community and context. In local practice, barikan encompasses a range of communal rituals that express gratitude, honor ancestors, or protect against calamity. Its application has expanded from sacred rites aligned with the traditional calendar to more flexible occasions, such as the beginning of the planting season or the inauguration of public facilities. While its forms have adapted over time, its core significance endures as a spiritual medium that reinforces solidarity and maintains balance between humans, nature, and supernatural forces.",

The ceremony is held at the village’s sacred site with a buffalo as the offering as a symbolic vehicle to the afterlife. Its purpose is to cleanse the village from disturbances of the spirits and to purify the souls to be sent to their original, perfect realm, namely Nirvana. Philosophically, unan-unan is understood as a means of completing spiritual and moral shortcomings within an eight-year cycle.",

Upacara ini tidak dilakukan berdasarkan hitungan hari ke-1000 secara ketat, tetapi lebih pada saat keluarga telah mengumpulkan modal besar untuk menyelenggarakan ritual ini. \"The rite is intended to remove impurities from the souls of the dead, so that those spirits may rise (meritas) to the heavens\" (Hefner, 1989:17). Dalam pandangan masyarakat Tengger, meskipun sering disamakan dengan nyewu oleh pihak luar, entas-entas memiliki struktur liturgi yang jauh lebih kompleks dan mendalam. \"The Tengger entas-entas serves not simply to commemorate the dead, but to aid in their passage to heaven... Its prayers are the longest, its offerings the most abundant, and its ritual the most powerful of any household ritual performed by a priest\" (Hefner, 1989:163). Dalam tradisi kolonial, ritual ini dikenal sebagai sedekah entas-entas atau sedekah njèwoe, dan sering dilakukan untuk banyak arwah sekaligus, diwakili oleh simbol roh bernama pètro yang terbuat dari berbagai daun dan janur kuning (Jasper, 1928:74). Upacara ini dimaksudkan untuk menyucikan roh orang yang telah meninggal dunia pada hari ke-1000 agar masuk surga (Sutarto, 2006:8). \"Entas-entas merupakan upacara terakhir untuk orang meninggal. Dalam pelaksanaannya, upacara ini membutuhkan banyak orang untuk bethek-sinoman.\" (Sukmawan, 2020:19).",
            "commonMeaning": "Entas-entas adalah ritual pascakematian khas masyarakat Tengger yang bertujuan menyucikan arwah leluhur dan menuntun mereka menuju alam surga. Tidak semata sebagai bentuk penghormatan, upacara ini bersifat kolektif dan dilaksanakan ketika keluarga telah mencapai kesiapan ekonomi maupun sosial. Ia merepresentasikan hubungan spiritual antara keluarga dan leluhur melalui rangkaian ritus sakral yang kompleks, persembahan dalam jumlah besar, serta representasi simbolik arwah melalui wujud pètro dari janur dan dedaunan.",
            "translation": "Entas-entas is a post-mortem ritual unique to the Tengger community that purifies the ancestral spirits and guide them to the heaven. More than a mere act of reverence, this ceremony is collective in nature and is performed once the family is economically and socially sufficient. It represents the spiritual bond between the family and their ancestors through a series of complex sacred rites, large-scale offerings, and the symbolic representation of the spirit in the form of pètro made from young coconut leaves and leaves.",
            "variant": "Dalam bahasa Jawa Timur sehari-hari, entas dan bentukannya seperti mentas mengalami perluasan makna yang bersifat kontekstual. Entas dipakai untuk ‘mengangkat’ atau ‘mengambil dari tempat semula’, sedangkan mentas lazim digunakan untuk aktivitas yang terkait air, misalnya “mentas saka kolam” (naik dari kolam) atau “mentas adus” (selesai mandi), dengan makna dasar ‘keluar dari’ atau ‘terlepas dari suatu keadaan’. Secara semantis, keduanya berpijak pada konsep ‘pembebasan’ atau ‘pemindahan’, sebagaimana tercermin dalam makna ritual entas-entas. Di Pacitan, entas-entas berarti mengumpulkan padi dari tiap rumah sebagai bagian pesta panen, sedangkan dalam tradisi Jawa istilah nyewu kerap diasosiasikan sebagai padanan ritual, meski berbeda dalam struktur dan simbolik. Variasi ini menunjukkan bahwa entas tidak hanya hidup dalam ranah spiritual, tetapi juga membumi dalam praktik keseharian masyarakat Jawa Timur.",
            "variantTranslations": "In East Javanese collocation, entas and its derivative forms, such as mentas, have undergone a contextual expansion of meaning. Entas generally refers to ‘lifting’ or ‘taking from its original place,’ while mentas is commonly used in water-related contexts, for example, “mentas saka kolam” (getting out of a pool) or “mentas adus” (finishing a bath), carrying the basic sense of ‘getting out of’ or ‘being released from’ a situation. Semantically, both terms are grounded in the concepts of ‘liberation’ or ‘transfer,’ as reflected in the entas-entas ritual. In Pacitan, entas-entas involves collecting rice from each household as part of a harvest festival, whereas in broader Javanese tradition, the term nyewu is often considered a ritual equivalent, though differing in structure and symbolism. This variation demonstrates that entas exists not only in the spiritual sphere but is also embedded in the everyday practices of East Javanese society.",

Supported by food contributions from all households in the village, attendance is restricted to village officials and the priest” (Hefner, 1989:112-113).\n\"The pujan illustrates this pattern clearly, and also shows to what degree ordinary villagers are drawn into the ceremony... The actual ritual service—a more or less standard invocation of the gods—lasts only about five minutes. The remainder of the evening is devoted to the meal... The pujan circuit is completed the following morning. Trays of cooked food (ater-ater) are sent from the priest’s house to village officials, and small earth offerings are set out by the roadside, cemetery, bridge, and other locations around the village.\" (Hefner, 1985: 114).\n\"Manusia harus mengadakan pujan pada bulan purnama, tilem, galungan, panawangan, kasada, dan kapitu. Jika pujan dilaksanakan, Durga-Kala tidak akan mengganggu manusia.

            "variant": "Dalam bahasa Jawa klasik dan krama, puja berarti penghormatan, doa, atau sembah, dengan turunan morfologis seperti pujan (sarana atau hasil pemujaan) dan pêpujan (yang dipuja atau diagungkan). Di Tengger, pujan terspesifikasi menjadi ritual kolektif yang terikat pada siklus waktu dan struktur sosial desa, bersifat khas, dan tidak ditemukan pada komunitas Jawa lain. Meski berkerabat dengan selametan atau kenduren, pujan berbeda dalam penanggalan, peran dukun desa, dan tata persembahan yang lebih terstruktur. Dalam praktik Hindu dan Buddha, puja tetap berarti sembahyang, tetapi tanpa dimensi sosial-komunal sebagaimana di Tengger. Pujan juga telah bertransformasi dari perjamuan besar yang terbuka menjadi doa simbolik terbatas, meski tetap menuntut kontribusi kolektif. Perubahan ini mencerminkan adaptasi terhadap modernitas, dengan makna inti sebagai penghormatan ilahiah dan penjaga harmoni desa yang tetap lestari.",
            "variantTranslations": "In classical and krama Javanese (honorifics), puja denotes reverence, prayer, or worship, with related morphological forms such as pujan (the means or outcome of worship) and pêpujan (that which is worshipped or glorified). Among Tengger people, pujan has evolved into a distinctive collective ritual tied to the cycle of time and the village’s social structure, a practice unique to this community and not found elsewhere in Java. While related to selametan or kenduren, pujan differs in its calendar, the role of the village shaman, and the more structured nature of its offerings. In Hindu and Buddhist contexts, puja continues to signify prayer, though without the socio-communal dimension characteristic of Tengger. Over time, pujan has shifted from a large, open-air feast to a more limited, symbolic form of prayer, while still requiring collective contributions. These transformations reflect adaptation to modernity, preserving both its core meaning of divine reverence and the maintenance of sustainable village harmony.",

Berdasarkan pengertian tersebut, dapat disimpulkan bahwa seorang warok memiliki kemampuan supranatural atau kesaktian yang di gunakan untuk menolong sesama. Pendapat lain mengenai istilah waro berasal dari kata wewarah. Kata wewarah dari bahasa arab wara yang berarti ‘menjauhkan diri dari segala syubhat’.

Upacara ini dimaksudkan untuk membersihkan desa dari gangguan makhluk halus dan menyucikan para arwah yang belum sempurna agar dapat kembali ke alam asal yang sempurna, yaitu Nirwana. Kata unan-unan berasal dari kata tuna ‘rugi’, maksudnya upacara ini dapat melengkapi kekurangan-kekurangan yang diperbuat selama satu windu (Sutarto, 2006: 8). Setahun sekali diadakan festival besar Oenan-Oenan demi kebaikan desa, untuk setiap kesempatan biasanya seekor sapi atau kerbau disembelih (Jasper, 1927:23). \"Unan-unan merupakan upacara adat masyarakat Tengger yang diseleggarakan setiap lima tahun sekali.

Upacara ini diadakan di tempat suci desa dengan persembahan seekor kerbau sebagai wahana simbolis menuju alam baka. Tujuannya adalah membersihkan desa dari gangguan makhluk halus serta menyucikan arwah agar kembali ke alam asal yang sempurna, yaitu Nirwana. Secara filosofis, unan-unan dimaknai sebagai pelengkap atas kekurangan spiritual dan moral dalam satu siklus windu.",
          "translation": "Unan-unan is the reduplicated and affixed form of the word tuna (“loss”) which literally means a ritual to “fill” or “complete.” In Tengger tradition, unan-unan is a sacred quinquennial ritual performed in a leap month based on the synchronization of the lunar and solar calendars. The ceremony is held at the village’s sacred site with a buffalo as the offering as a symbolic vehicle to the afterlife. Its purpose is to cleanse the village from disturbances of the spirits and to purify the souls to be sent to their original, perfect realm, namely Nirvana. Philosophically, unan-unan is understood as a means of completing spiritual and moral shortcomings within an eight-year cycle.",

Trays of cooked food (ater-ater) are sent from the priest’s house to village officials, and small earth offerings are set out by the roadside, cemetery, bridge, and other locations around the village.\" (Hefner, 1985: 114).\n\"Manusia harus mengadakan pujan pada bulan purnama, tilem, galungan, panawangan, kasada, dan kapitu. Jika pujan dilaksanakan, Durga-Kala tidak akan mengganggu manusia. Ketiga Dewa tersebut terus-menerus mengajari manusia cara memuja dan memberikan sesaji kepada Durga-Kala sebagai manifestasi Sang Hyang Widhi.\" (Sukmawan, 2018:123).",
          "commonMeaning": "Pujan adalah ritual pemujaan masyarakat Tengger yang berakar dari kata Sanskerta dan Jawa Kuno puja (‘penghormatan, penyembahan, dan doa’). Ritual ini merupakan bagian dari kalender desa yang dilaksanakan pada bulan tertentu setiap tahun. Dahulu berupa perjamuan besar di rumah dukun pendeta desa, kini pujan berlangsung sebagai doa singkat dan jamuan simbolik yang dihadiri pendeta serta pejabat desa dengan dukungan makanan warga. Rangkaian pujan ditutup dengan pengiriman hidangan kepada tokoh desa dan persembahan kecil di tempat sakral sebagai wujud keterlibatan spiritual komunitas.",
          "translation": "Pujan is a worship ritual of the Tengger community. The name rooted in the Sanskrit and Old Javanese word puja (‘respect, worship, and prayer’). This ritual is within the village calendar and is held in certain month every year. In the past, Pujan took the form of a grand feast at the village priest’s house. Today, pujan is held as a brief prayer and symbolic banquet attended by priests and village officials, with food contributed by the community. The series of pujan concludes with the distribution of dishes to village leaders and small offerings at sacred sites as a manifestation of the community’s spiritual involvement.",
          "variant": "Dalam bahasa Jawa klasik dan krama, puja berarti penghormatan, doa, atau sembah, dengan turunan morfologis seperti pujan (sarana atau hasil pemujaan) dan pêpujan (yang dipuja atau diagungkan). Di Tengger, pujan terspesifikasi menjadi ritual kolektif yang terikat pada siklus waktu dan struktur sosial desa, bersifat khas, dan tidak ditemukan pada komunitas Jawa lain. Meski berkerabat dengan selametan atau kenduren, pujan berbeda dalam penanggalan, peran dukun desa, dan tata persembahan yang lebih terstruktur. Dalam praktik Hindu dan Buddha, puja tetap berarti sembahyang, tetapi tanpa dimensi sosial-komunal sebagaimana di Tengger. Pujan juga telah bertransformasi dari perjamuan besar yang terbuka menjadi doa simbolik terbatas, meski tetap menuntut kontribusi kolektif. Perubahan ini mencerminkan adaptasi terhadap modernitas, dengan makna inti sebagai penghormatan ilahiah dan penjaga harmoni desa yang tetap lestari.",
          "variantTranslations": "In classical and krama Javanese (honorifics), puja denotes reverence, prayer, or worship, with related morphological forms such as pujan (the means or outcome of worship) and pêpujan (that which is worshipped or glorified). Among Tengger people, pujan has evolved into a distinctive collective ritual tied to the cycle of time and the village’s social structure, a practice unique to this community and not found elsewhere in Java. While related to selametan or kenduren, pujan differs in its calendar, the role of the village shaman, and the more structured nature of its offerings. In Hindu and Buddhist contexts, puja continues to signify prayer, though without the socio-communal dimension characteristic of Tengger. Over time, pujan has shifted from a large, open-air feast to a more limited, symbolic form of prayer, while still requiring collective contributions. These transformations reflect adaptation to modernity, preserving both its core meaning of divine reverence and the maintenance of sustainable village harmony.",

Berdasarkan pengertian tersebut, dapat disimpulkan bahwa seorang warok memiliki kemampuan supranatural atau kesaktian yang di gunakan untuk menolong sesama. Pendapat lain mengenai istilah waro berasal dari kata wewarah. Kata wewarah dari bahasa arab wara yang berarti ‘menjauhkan diri dari segala syubhat’. Wewarah seringkali dimaknai wong kang sugih wewarah ‘orang yang kaya pentunjuk’.

Gerakan tarinya yang cekatan dan akrobatik sangat menarik perhatian masyarakat, dengan aksesori topeng bermata melotot sebagai simbol kejelian, kecermatan, dan ketelitian dalam menjalankan titah Raja Prabu Klanasewandana. Secara fisik, penari ini menggunakan topeng putih setengah wajah berhidung tumpul yang diidentifikasi sebagai topeng Pëntoel, meskipun menurut Tuan Staugaard terdapat penari topeng lain dengan topeng hitam yang juga disebut Pëntoel, menunjukkan adanya variasi dalam representasi tokoh ini dalam pertunjukan Reog.",
          "translation": "Pujangga Anom, also known as Pujangganong or Bujanganom, is a warlord figure from the Bantarangin Kingdom who embodies an energetic, agile, and acrobatic military leader, reflecting the noble qualities of a patih who is devoted and responsible in managing the kingdom's strategic affairs. His lively and acrobatic dance movements make this character especially appealing to audiences, accompanied by the use of a mask with bulging eyes as a symbol of sharpness, alertness, and precision in carrying out the commands of King Prabu Klono Sewandono. Physically, the dancer typically wears a white half-face mask with a blunt nose, identified as the Pëntoel mask, although according to Mr. Staugaard, there are also dancers who use black masks referred to by the same name, indicating variations in how this figure is represented in Reog performances.",

          "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Panaraga is an area that has been etched into the collective memory of Javanese history, with its ancient identity as the region of Wĕngkĕr. This is mentioned in the books Pararaton and Negara Kartagama (D.J Brandes, 1897). Etymologically, the name Wĕngkĕr derives from the phrase wĕngonan angker 'haunted place', which refers to the concept of a place filled with mystical and supernatural aura (Moelyadi, 1986). In the Serat Centhini, canto 213, as translated by Stein Callenfels, there is a narrative that strengthens the historical legacy of Panaraga, which asserts that Wĕngkĕr held an important position in the history of classical Javanese civilization and became the undeniable historical identity of Panaraga.\n\n Geographically, the Panaraga sub-ethnic group refers to the area in the western part of East Java Province, now known as Ponorogo Regency, stretching from the western side of Mount Wilis to eastern side of Mount Lawu. According to Junghuhn's records (1855), numerous altars and terraces resembling worship sites were discovered, which were considered by ancient Javanese society as the dwelling places of gods and sacred crowns. Valentijn (1862) provided a more detailed description that the Panaraga region stretched from Pacitan Bay on the southern coast to Sumbang Village with approximately 150 families, extending two miles east of Mount Lawu, bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south and Lodaya to the east, with the Semangi River in Sangkulang Village serving as an important geographical marker and Mount Wilis as a natural boundary between Panaraga, Nganjuk and Kediri.\n\n In sociocultural context, the Dutch Resident in Madiun, Lucien Adam (1938), provided interesting anthropological notes regarding the characteristics of the Panaraga sub-ethnic community: \n\n The mystery of the origin of the Panaraga people has not been clearly revealed. Although they do not live in isolation from the surrounding areas, their types and characters differ from surrounding districts. People from Panaraga are more independent and self-confident, but also tough, brave, reckless, quick-tempered, and prefer to travel compared to average people in central Java.\n\n Adam's observations reveal the unique temperament of the Panaraga ethnic group, which differs from the general Javanese ethnic group, possessing an independent, brave, and highly adventurous spirit, represented by the figure of Warok as their sociocultural identity. Terminologically, Warok comes from the word waro'i or wirangi, which means 'already understands both physically and spiritually, whose actions are solely to help others', or from the word wewarah (Arabic: wara') which means 'to distance oneself from doubtful things', thus Warok can be interpreted as individual with supernatural power who uses their abilities for social good and holds a high status in Panaraga society. \n\n The existence of Warok cannot be separated from the art of reyog—both are like two sides of a coin united in the ethnic identity of Panaraga. The word reyog itself has various debated interpretations, ranging from the onomatopoeic hypothesis of the riyeg-riyeg bamboo sound to Mbah Wo Kucing's philosophical interpretation, which states REYOG as an acronym for five spiritual elements (R: rasa kidung (feeling of song), E: engwang sukma adiluhung (noble soul's essence), Y: Yang Widhi (The Divine), O: olah kridhaning Gusti (the Lord's creative act), G: gelar gumulung kĕrsaning Kang Maha Kuasa (the unfolding of the Almighty's will)), which means that reyog is not merely a performing art but a spiritual medium that connects humans with the divine dimension through artistic expression rich in the philosophical values of the Ponorogo community.\n\nRegardless of various etymological interpretations, the art of reyog was born from a complex socio-political context as a form of criticism by Warok Ki Ageng Kutu Suryaalam against the Majapahit government under the rule of King Brawijaya V, which was considered overly dominated by the queen consort. The phenomenon is symbolized in the form of singa barong or dadak merak—a tiger's head with a peacock's neck—which represents a subtle satire of a leadership that has lost its direction and power. \n\nPanaraga, with its historical and cultural identity, offers a unique depiction of cultural complexity within the mosaic of Javanese culture, featuring Warok as a central figure and reyog as an artistic expression rich in cultural and philosophical meaning. Therefore, this cultural heritage not only becomes a historical asset but also a living identity that must be continuously preserved by future generations as the proud ethnic identity of Panaraga.",

          "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Panaraga is an area that has been etched into the collective memory of Javanese history, with its ancient identity as the region of Wĕngkĕr. This is mentioned in the books Pararaton and Negara Kartagama (D.J Brandes, 1897). Etymologically, the name Wĕngkĕr derives from the phrase wĕngonan angker 'haunted place', which refers to the concept of a place filled with mystical and supernatural aura (Moelyadi, 1986). In the Serat Centhini, canto 213, as translated by Stein Callenfels, there is a narrative that strengthens the historical legacy of Panaraga, which asserts that Wĕngkĕr held an important position in the history of classical Javanese civilization and became the undeniable historical identity of Panaraga.\n\n Geographically, the Panaraga sub-ethnic group refers to the area in the western part of East Java Province, now known as Ponorogo Regency, stretching from the western side of Mount Wilis to eastern side of Mount Lawu. According to Junghuhn's records (1855), numerous altars and terraces resembling worship sites were discovered, which were considered by ancient Javanese society as the dwelling places of gods and sacred crowns. Valentijn (1862) provided a more detailed description that the Panaraga region stretched from Pacitan Bay on the southern coast to Sumbang Village with approximately 150 families, extending two miles east of Mount Lawu, bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south and Lodaya to the east, with the Semangi River in Sangkulang Village serving as an important geographical marker and Mount Wilis as a natural boundary between Panaraga, Nganjuk and Kediri.\n\n In sociocultural context, the Dutch Resident in Madiun, Lucien Adam (1938), provided interesting anthropological notes regarding the characteristics of the Panaraga sub-ethnic community: \n\n The mystery of the origin of the Panaraga people has not been clearly revealed. Although they do not live in isolation from the surrounding areas, their types and characters differ from surrounding districts. People from Panaraga are more independent and self-confident, but also tough, brave, reckless, quick-tempered, and prefer to travel compared to average people in central Java.\n\n Adam's observations reveal the unique temperament of the Panaraga ethnic group, which differs from the general Javanese ethnic group, possessing an independent, brave, and highly adventurous spirit, represented by the figure of Warok as their sociocultural identity. Terminologically, Warok comes from the word waro'i or wirangi, which means 'already understands both physically and spiritually, whose actions are solely to help others', or from the word wewarah (Arabic: wara') which means 'to distance oneself from doubtful things', thus Warok can be interpreted as individual with supernatural power who uses their abilities for social good and holds a high status in Panaraga society. \n\n The existence of Warok cannot be separated from the art of reyog—both are like two sides of a coin united in the ethnic identity of Panaraga. The word reyog itself has various debated interpretations, ranging from the onomatopoeic hypothesis of the riyeg-riyeg bamboo sound to Mbah Wo Kucing's philosophical interpretation, which states REYOG as an acronym for five spiritual elements (R: rasa kidung (feeling of song), E: engwang sukma adiluhung (noble soul's essence), Y: Yang Widhi (The Divine), O: olah kridhaning Gusti (the Lord's creative act), G: gelar gumulung kĕrsaning Kang Maha Kuasa (the unfolding of the Almighty's will)), which means that reyog is not merely a performing art but a spiritual medium that connects humans with the divine dimension through artistic expression rich in the philosophical values of the Ponorogo community.\n\nRegardless of various etymological interpretations, the art of reyog was born from a complex socio-political context as a form of criticism by Warok Ki Ageng Kutu Suryaalam against the Majapahit government under the rule of King Brawijaya V, which was considered overly dominated by the queen consort. The phenomenon is symbolized in the form of singa barong or dadak merak—a tiger's head with a peacock's neck—which represents a subtle satire of a leadership that has lost its direction and power. \n\nPanaraga, with its historical and cultural identity, offers a unique depiction of cultural complexity within the mosaic of Javanese culture, featuring Warok as a central figure and reyog as an artistic expression rich in cultural and philosophical meaning. Therefore, this cultural heritage not only becomes a historical asset but also a living identity that must be continuously preserved by future generations as the proud ethnic identity of Panaraga.",

          "greetingMeaning": "\"Om, (Brahmā, Visnū, Sivā), I wish for eternal well-being\"",
          "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Tengger in Old Javanese means “highlands” (Gericke and Roorda, 1901:918), and thus the meaning of Wong Tengger would have mean persons who lived in highlands. In nowadays Java, Tengger no longer refer to that, but cover to “perch and sit above” (Hefner, 1985:25). Wong Tengger ‘Tengger People’ are indigenous community who resides and surrounds around the slope of Mountain Brahma (Bromo). The Tengger highlands locates to the northeast from Malang. There are three gates to reach there: (1) the first route is going to the north from Malang to Pasuruan or Purwodadi, we will find the main entrance Wonokitri village in Tosari district and going up to the Ngadiwono village. These regions well known as western side (brang kulon) of Tengger highlands; (2) the second route is heading to Probolinggo, we will reach the main entrance is Cemoro Lawang village (Ngadisari district) and directly overlooks mount Bromo and Tengger caldera. These gates are popularly known as eastern side (brang wetan) of Tengger highlands; (3) the third access has two kinds of gates: (1) heading to Tumpang, Malang then we will reach the Gubugklakah, and the main gate is Ngadas village; (2) heading to Lumajang, and climbing to Senduro, Ranupani. These regions are known as southern (brang kidul) of Tengger highlands.\n\nHong hulun Basuki Langgeng\n\nHong Hulun Basuki Langgeng is Tenggerese salutation. This formula consists of four words in Old Javenese: Oṅ or Om is often referred to mantra or formula praise; ṅhulun is the usual pronoun for the first person (Zoetmulder:1982). Whilst the rest of the words are still existed in modern Javanese, basuki means well-being, and laṅgĕṅ holds the meaning permanent. So, the Tenggerese salutation can be interpreted in the following: “Om, (Brahmā, Visnū, Sivā), I wish for eternal well-being”. Then, the receiver will reply: basuki laṅgĕṅ ‘well-being forever’. This salutation is given when someone visit their relatives by knocking the door or for maintaining social relationship among Tenggerese when they meet each other in market or climbing up to the Bromo.\n\nDukun Panḍita as divine actors \n\nIn order to maintain the divine relationship between the people of Tengger and their deities and ancestor, the role of dukun panḍita (priest of Tengger) is central (Sukmawan, 2022:14). In the rituals that they perform, the priest is acting like the middleman who mediate the realm world to divine world. By uttering their formulas (mantra) and mentioning the means of the ritual, the priest communicates to the unseen figures to the man who dedicated their offerings to their deities or ancestors. In all the rituals that are performed by Tenggerese, the priest is the main actor. Tenggerese often call the name of the dukun as Rama. Every Tengger villages has dukun and the assistant of the dukun. dukun as Rama. Every Tengger villages has dukun and the assistant of the dukun.",

This is mentioned in the books Pararaton and Negara Kartagama (D.J Brandes, 1897). Etymologically, the name Wĕngkĕr derives from the phrase wĕngonan angker 'haunted place', which refers to the concept of a place filled with mystical and supernatural aura (Moelyadi, 1986). In the Serat Centhini, canto 213, as translated by Stein Callenfels, there is a narrative that strengthens the historical legacy of Panaraga, which asserts that Wĕngkĕr held an important position in the history of classical Javanese civilization and became the undeniable historical identity of Panaraga.\n\n Geographically, the Panaraga sub-ethnic group refers to the area in the western part of East Java Province, now known as Ponorogo Regency, stretching from the western side of Mount Wilis to eastern side of Mount Lawu.

          "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Panaraga is an area that has been etched into the collective memory of Javanese history, with its ancient identity as the region of Wĕngkĕr. This is mentioned in the books Pararaton and Negara Kartagama (D.J Brandes, 1897). Etymologically, the name Wĕngkĕr derives from the phrase wĕngonan angker 'haunted place', which refers to the concept of a place filled with mystical and supernatural aura (Moelyadi, 1986). In the Serat Centhini, canto 213, as translated by Stein Callenfels, there is a narrative that strengthens the historical legacy of Panaraga, which asserts that Wĕngkĕr held an important position in the history of classical Javanese civilization and became the undeniable historical identity of Panaraga.\n\n Geographically, the Panaraga sub-ethnic group refers to the area in the western part of East Java Province, now known as Ponorogo Regency, stretching from the western side of Mount Wilis to eastern side of Mount Lawu. According to Junghuhn's records (1855), numerous altars and terraces resembling worship sites were discovered, which were considered by ancient Javanese society as the dwelling places of gods and sacred crowns. Valentijn (1862) provided a more detailed description that the Panaraga region stretched from Pacitan Bay on the southern coast to Sumbang Village with approximately 150 families, extending two miles east of Mount Lawu, bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south and Lodaya to the east, with the Semangi River in Sangkulang Village serving as an important geographical marker and Mount Wilis as a natural boundary between Panaraga, Nganjuk and Kediri.\n\n In sociocultural context, the Dutch Resident in Madiun, Lucien Adam (1938), provided interesting anthropological notes regarding the characteristics of the Panaraga sub-ethnic community: \n\n The mystery of the origin of the Panaraga people has not been clearly revealed. Although they do not live in isolation from the surrounding areas, their types and characters differ from surrounding districts. People from Panaraga are more independent and self-confident, but also tough, brave, reckless, quick-tempered, and prefer to travel compared to average people in central Java.\n\n Adam's observations reveal the unique temperament of the Panaraga ethnic group, which differs from the general Javanese ethnic group, possessing an independent, brave, and highly adventurous spirit, represented by the figure of Warok as their sociocultural identity. Terminologically, Warok comes from the word waro'i or wirangi, which means 'already understands both physically and spiritually, whose actions are solely to help others', or from the word wewarah (Arabic: wara') which means 'to distance oneself from doubtful things', thus Warok can be interpreted as individual with supernatural power who uses their abilities for social good and holds a high status in Panaraga society. \n\n The existence of Warok cannot be separated from the art of reyog—both are like two sides of a coin united in the ethnic identity of Panaraga. The word reyog itself has various debated interpretations, ranging from the onomatopoeic hypothesis of the riyeg-riyeg bamboo sound to Mbah Wo Kucing's philosophical interpretation, which states REYOG as an acronym for five spiritual elements (R: rasa kidung (feeling of song), E: engwang sukma adiluhung (noble soul's essence), Y: Yang Widhi (The Divine), O: olah kridhaning Gusti (the Lord's creative act), G: gelar gumulung kĕrsaning Kang Maha Kuasa (the unfolding of the Almighty's will)), which means that reyog is not merely a performing art but a spiritual medium that connects humans with the divine dimension through artistic expression rich in the philosophical values of the Ponorogo community.\n\nRegardless of various etymological interpretations, the art of reyog was born from a complex socio-political context as a form of criticism by Warok Ki Ageng Kutu Suryaalam against the Majapahit government under the rule of King Brawijaya V, which was considered overly dominated by the queen consort. The phenomenon is symbolized in the form of singa barong or dadak merak—a tiger's head with a peacock's neck—which represents a subtle satire of a leadership that has lost its direction and power. \n\nPanaraga, with its historical and cultural identity, offers a unique depiction of cultural complexity within the mosaic of Javanese culture, featuring Warok as a central figure and reyog as an artistic expression rich in cultural and philosophical meaning. Therefore, this cultural heritage not only becomes a historical asset but also a living identity that must be continuously preserved by future generations as the proud ethnic identity of Panaraga.",

According to Junghuhn's records (1855), numerous altars and terraces resembling worship sites were discovered, which were considered by ancient Javanese society as the dwelling places of gods and sacred crowns. Valentijn (1862) provided a more detailed description that the Panaraga region stretched from Pacitan Bay on the southern coast to Sumbang Village with approximately 150 families, extending two miles east of Mount Lawu, bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south and Lodaya to the east, with the Semangi River in Sangkulang Village serving as an important geographical marker and Mount Wilis as a natural boundary between Panaraga, Nganjuk and Kediri.\n\n In sociocultural context, the Dutch Resident in Madiun, Lucien Adam (1938), provided interesting anthropological notes regarding the characteristics of the Panaraga sub-ethnic community: \n\n The mystery of the origin of the Panaraga people has not been clearly revealed. Although they do not live in isolation from the surrounding areas, their types and characters differ from surrounding districts. People from Panaraga are more independent and self-confident, but also tough, brave, reckless, quick-tempered, and prefer to travel compared to average people in central Java.\n\n Adam's observations reveal the unique temperament of the Panaraga ethnic group, which differs from the general Javanese ethnic group, possessing an independent, brave, and highly adventurous spirit, represented by the figure of Warok as their sociocultural identity. Terminologically, Warok comes from the word waro'i or wirangi, which means 'already understands both physically and spiritually, whose actions are solely to help others', or from the word wewarah (Arabic: wara') which means 'to distance oneself from doubtful things', thus Warok can be interpreted as individual with supernatural power who uses their abilities for social good and holds a high status in Panaraga society. \n\n The existence of Warok cannot be separated from the art of reyog—both are like two sides of a coin united in the ethnic identity of Panaraga. The word reyog itself has various debated interpretations, ranging from the onomatopoeic hypothesis of the riyeg-riyeg bamboo sound to Mbah Wo Kucing's philosophical interpretation, which states REYOG as an acronym for five spiritual elements (R: rasa kidung (feeling of song), E: engwang sukma adiluhung (noble soul's essence), Y: Yang Widhi (The Divine), O: olah kridhaning Gusti (the Lord's creative act), G: gelar gumulung kĕrsaning Kang Maha Kuasa (the unfolding of the Almighty's will)), which means that reyog is not merely a performing art but a spiritual medium that connects humans with the divine dimension through artistic expression rich in the philosophical values of the Ponorogo community.\n\nRegardless of various etymological interpretations, the art of reyog was born from a complex socio-political context as a form of criticism by Warok Ki Ageng Kutu Suryaalam against the Majapahit government under the rule of King Brawijaya V, which was considered overly dominated by the queen consort.

          "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Tengger in Old Javanese means “highlands” (Gericke and Roorda, 1901:918), and thus the meaning of Wong Tengger would have mean persons who lived in highlands. In nowadays Java, Tengger no longer refer to that, but cover to “perch and sit above” (Hefner, 1985:25). Wong Tengger ‘Tengger People’ are indigenous community who resides and surrounds around the slope of Mountain Brahma (Bromo). The Tengger highlands locates to the northeast from Malang. There are three gates to reach there: (1) the first route is going to the north from Malang to Pasuruan or Purwodadi, we will find the main entrance Wonokitri village in Tosari district and going up to the Ngadiwono village. These regions well known as western side (brang kulon) of Tengger highlands; (2) the second route is heading to Probolinggo, we will reach the main entrance is Cemoro Lawang village (Ngadisari district) and directly overlooks mount Bromo and Tengger caldera. These gates are popularly known as eastern side (brang wetan) of Tengger highlands; (3) the third access has two kinds of gates: (1) heading to Tumpang, Malang then we will reach the Gubugklakah, and the main gate is Ngadas village; (2) heading to Lumajang, and climbing to Senduro, Ranupani. These regions are known as southern (brang kidul) of Tengger highlands.\n\nHong hulun Basuki Langgeng\n\nHong Hulun Basuki Langgeng is Tenggerese salutation. This formula consists of four words in Old Javenese: Oṅ or Om is often referred to mantra or formula praise; ṅhulun is the usual pronoun for the first person (Zoetmulder:1982). Whilst the rest of the words are still existed in modern Javanese, basuki means well-being, and laṅgĕṅ holds the meaning permanent. So, the Tenggerese salutation can be interpreted in the following: “Om, (Brahmā, Visnū, Sivā), I wish for eternal well-being”. Then, the receiver will reply: basuki laṅgĕṅ ‘well-being forever’. This salutation is given when someone visit their relatives by knocking the door or for maintaining social relationship among Tenggerese when they meet each other in market or climbing up to the Bromo.\n\nDukun Panḍita as divine actors \n\nIn order to maintain the divine relationship between the people of Tengger and their deities and ancestor, the role of dukun panḍita (priest of Tengger) is central (Sukmawan, 2022:14). In the rituals that they perform, the priest is acting like the middleman who mediate the realm world to divine world. By uttering their formulas (mantra) and mentioning the means of the ritual, the priest communicates to the unseen figures to the man who dedicated their offerings to their deities or ancestors. In all the rituals that are performed by Tenggerese, the priest is the main actor. Tenggerese often call the name of the dukun as Rama. Every Tengger villages has dukun and the assistant of the dukun. dukun as Rama. Every Tengger villages has dukun and the assistant of the dukun.",

          "culturalMeaning": "Its precise etymology unclear, the barikan is identified by modern Tengger as a rite of balikan or the \"turning back\" of evil from the village. In some communities barikan occurs every thirty-five days, but in others it takes place only after eclipses, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions. The liturgy is celebrated at the village chief's house. Women bring baskets of cooked food to the front steps of the house. While village officials act as \"witnesses,\" the priest blesses the food and returns half to the women. The half which remains is used to make a communion meal for the priest and village officials. The half taken home is eaten by members of each household, who thereby share in its blessing. A small portion of the home food is in addition made into tamping earth offerings, set out by each family around the house and fields. (Hefner, 1985: 123). \"Slametan Barian yang dilaksanakan setiap bulan sekali pada hari Jumat pasaran Legi dilaksanakan dalam rangka meminta perlindungan dan keselamatan kosmis.\" (Sukmawan, 2018:88). Upacara ini dilakukan kalau terjadi gerhana, gempa dan peristiwaperistiwa alam lainnya yang ada hubungan erat dengan kehidupan manusia. Terjadinya peristiwa-peristiwa alam akan mempengaruhi kehidupan manusia tergantung dari waktu terjadinya jam berapa, hari apa, bulan dan tahun apa. (Proyek Sasana Budaya Jakarta, 1978). Ritual untuk keselamatan dan dapat menolak bahaya (tolak sengkala) yang bakal datang, tetapi juga diadakan sebagai tanda terima kasih kepada Hyang Maha Agung (Sutarto, 2006: 10).

Barikan dilaksanakan di rumah pemimpin adat dan dipimpin dukun, dengan sajian makanan yang dibagi dua: sebagian disantap dalam kebersamaan ritual, sisanya dibawa pulang sebagai sesaji di pekarangan dan ladang.

Grounded in the belief in the relationship between humans, nature, ancestors, and supernatural forces, the rite serves to restore disrupted harmony. Barikan is held at customary leader's residence and led by the village dukun (shaman). The food offerings in this rite are split to two: one portion to be consumed together during the ritual gathering, and another taken home as offerings in yards and fields. Beyond spiritual protection, barikan is also understood as an expression of gratitude and social solidarity strengthening.",

Penggunaannya meluas dari ritus sakral yang terikat penanggalan adat menjadi praktik yang lebih fleksibel, misalnya pada awal musim tanam atau pembukaan fasilitas umum.

In local practice, barikan encompasses a range of communal rituals that express gratitude, honor ancestors, or protect against calamity. Its application has expanded from sacred rites aligned with the traditional calendar to more flexible occasions, such as the beginning of the planting season or the inauguration of public facilities.

The ceremony is held at the village’s sacred site with a buffalo as the offering as a symbolic vehicle to the afterlife. Its purpose is to cleanse the village from disturbances of the spirits and to purify the souls to be sent to their original, perfect realm, namely Nirvana.

Upacara ini tidak dilakukan berdasarkan hitungan hari ke-1000 secara ketat, tetapi lebih pada saat keluarga telah mengumpulkan modal besar untuk menyelenggarakan ritual ini. \"The rite is intended to remove impurities from the souls of the dead, so that those spirits may rise (meritas) to the heavens\" (Hefner, 1989:17). Dalam pandangan masyarakat Tengger, meskipun sering disamakan dengan nyewu oleh pihak luar, entas-entas memiliki struktur liturgi yang jauh lebih kompleks dan mendalam. \"The Tengger entas-entas serves not simply to commemorate the dead, but to aid in their passage to heaven... Its prayers are the longest, its offerings the most abundant, and its ritual the most powerful of any household ritual performed by a priest\" (Hefner, 1989:163). Dalam tradisi kolonial, ritual ini dikenal sebagai sedekah entas-entas atau sedekah njèwoe, dan sering dilakukan untuk banyak arwah sekaligus, diwakili oleh simbol roh bernama pètro yang terbuat dari berbagai daun dan janur kuning (Jasper, 1928:74). Upacara ini dimaksudkan untuk menyucikan roh orang yang telah meninggal dunia pada hari ke-1000 agar masuk surga (Sutarto, 2006:8). \"Entas-entas merupakan upacara terakhir untuk orang meninggal.

          "translation": "Entas-entas is a post-mortem ritual unique to the Tengger community that purifies the ancestral spirits and guide them to the heaven. More than a mere act of reverence, this ceremony is collective in nature and is performed once the family is economically and socially sufficient.

Secara semantis, keduanya berpijak pada konsep ‘pembebasan’ atau ‘pemindahan’, sebagaimana tercermin dalam makna ritual entas-entas. Di Pacitan, entas-entas berarti mengumpulkan padi dari tiap rumah sebagai bagian pesta panen, sedangkan dalam tradisi Jawa istilah nyewu kerap diasosiasikan sebagai padanan ritual, meski berbeda dalam struktur dan simbolik. Variasi ini menunjukkan bahwa entas tidak hanya hidup dalam ranah spiritual, tetapi juga membumi dalam praktik keseharian masyarakat Jawa Timur.",
          "variantTranslations": "In East Javanese collocation, entas and its derivative forms, such as mentas, have undergone a contextual expansion of meaning. Entas generally refers to ‘lifting’ or ‘taking from its original place,’ while mentas is commonly used in water-related contexts, for example, “mentas saka kolam” (getting out of a pool) or “mentas adus” (finishing a bath), carrying the basic sense of ‘getting out of’ or ‘being released from’ a situation. Semantically, both terms are grounded in the concepts of ‘liberation’ or ‘transfer,’ as reflected in the entas-entas ritual. In Pacitan, entas-entas involves collecting rice from each household as part of a harvest festival, whereas in broader Javanese tradition, the term nyewu is often considered a ritual equivalent, though differing in structure and symbolism. This variation demonstrates that entas exists not only in the spiritual sphere but is also embedded in the everyday practices of East Javanese society.",

Supported by food contributions from all households in the village, attendance is restricted to village officials and the priest” (Hefner, 1989:112-113).\n\"The pujan illustrates this pattern clearly, and also shows to what degree ordinary villagers are drawn into the ceremony... The actual ritual service—a more or less standard invocation of the gods—lasts only about five minutes. The remainder of the evening is devoted to the meal... The pujan circuit is completed the following morning. Trays of cooked food (ater-ater) are sent from the priest’s house to village officials, and small earth offerings are set out by the roadside, cemetery, bridge, and other locations around the village.\" (Hefner, 1985: 114).\n\"Manusia harus mengadakan pujan pada bulan purnama, tilem, galungan, panawangan, kasada, dan kapitu. Jika pujan dilaksanakan, Durga-Kala tidak akan mengganggu manusia.

          "translation": "Pujan is a worship ritual of the Tengger community. The name rooted in the Sanskrit and Old Javanese word puja (‘respect, worship, and prayer’).

Di Tengger, pujan terspesifikasi menjadi ritual kolektif yang terikat pada siklus waktu dan struktur sosial desa, bersifat khas, dan tidak ditemukan pada komunitas Jawa lain. Meski berkerabat dengan selametan atau kenduren, pujan berbeda dalam penanggalan, peran dukun desa, dan tata persembahan yang lebih terstruktur. Dalam praktik Hindu dan Buddha, puja tetap berarti sembahyang, tetapi tanpa dimensi sosial-komunal sebagaimana di Tengger. Pujan juga telah bertransformasi dari perjamuan besar yang terbuka menjadi doa simbolik terbatas, meski tetap menuntut kontribusi kolektif. Perubahan ini mencerminkan adaptasi terhadap modernitas, dengan makna inti sebagai penghormatan ilahiah dan penjaga harmoni desa yang tetap lestari.",
          "variantTranslations": "In classical and krama Javanese (honorifics), puja denotes reverence, prayer, or worship, with related morphological forms such as pujan (the means or outcome of worship) and pêpujan (that which is worshipped or glorified). Among Tengger people, pujan has evolved into a distinctive collective ritual tied to the cycle of time and the village’s social structure, a practice unique to this community and not found elsewhere in Java. While related to selametan or kenduren, pujan differs in its calendar, the role of the village shaman, and the more structured nature of its offerings. In Hindu and Buddhist contexts, puja continues to signify prayer, though without the socio-communal dimension characteristic of Tengger. Over time, pujan has shifted from a large, open-air feast to a more limited, symbolic form of prayer, while still requiring collective contributions. These transformations reflect adaptation to modernity, preserving both its core meaning of divine reverence and the maintenance of sustainable village harmony.",

          "explanation": "Introduction\n\n Tengger in Old Javanese means “highlands” (Gericke and Roorda, 1901:918), and thus the meaning of Wong Tengger would have mean persons who lived in highlands. In nowadays Java, Tengger no longer refer to that, but cover to “perch and sit above” (Hefner, 1985:25). Wong Tengger ‘Tengger People’ are indigenous community who resides and surrounds around the slope of Mountain Brahma (Bromo). The Tengger highlands locates to the northeast from Malang. There are three gates to reach there: (1) the first route is going to the north from Malang to Pasuruan or Purwodadi, we will find the main entrance Wonokitri village in Tosari district and going up to the Ngadiwono village. These regions well known as western side (brang kulon) of Tengger highlands; (2) the second route is heading to Probolinggo, we will reach the main entrance is Cemoro Lawang village (Ngadisari district) and directly overlooks mount Bromo and Tengger caldera. These gates are popularly known as eastern side (brang wetan) of Tengger highlands; (3) the third access has two kinds of gates: (1) heading to Tumpang, Malang then we will reach the Gubugklakah, and the main gate is Ngadas village; (2) heading to Lumajang, and climbing to Senduro, Ranupani. These regions are known as southern (brang kidul) of Tengger highlands.\n\nHong hulun Basuki Langgeng\n\nHong Hulun Basuki Langgeng is Tenggerese salutation. This formula consists of four words in Old Javenese: Oṅ or Om is often referred to mantra or formula praise; ṅhulun is the usual pronoun for the first person (Zoetmulder:1982). Whilst the rest of the words are still existed in modern Javanese, basuki means well-being, and laṅgĕṅ holds the meaning permanent. So, the Tenggerese salutation can be interpreted in the following: “Om, (Brahmā, Visnū, Sivā), I wish for eternal well-being”. Then, the receiver will reply: basuki laṅgĕṅ ‘well-being forever’. This salutation is given when someone visit their relatives by knocking the door or for maintaining social relationship among Tenggerese when they meet each other in market or climbing up to the Bromo.\n\nDukun Panḍita as divine actors \n\nIn order to maintain the divine relationship between the people of Tengger and their deities and ancestor, the role of dukun panḍita (priest of Tengger) is central (Sukmawan, 2022:14). In the rituals that they perform, the priest is acting like the middleman who mediate the realm world to divine world. By uttering their formulas (mantra) and mentioning the means of the ritual, the priest communicates to the unseen figures to the man who dedicated their offerings to their deities or ancestors. In all the rituals that are performed by Tenggerese, the priest is the main actor. Tenggerese often call the name of the dukun as Rama. Every Tengger villages has dukun and the assistant of the dukun. dukun as Rama. Every Tengger villages has dukun and the assistant of the dukun.",
